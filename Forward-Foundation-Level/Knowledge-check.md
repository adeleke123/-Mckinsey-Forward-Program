## Focus on the journey
As you just saw, understanding when to set a learning intention versus a performance goal is an important first step.

Once we know we should set a learning intention, focusing on the journey—and linking to personal meaning—will strengthen your intention. Focusing on the journey means prioritizing the learning experience itself, not just the outcome. Instead of setting a specific target, we focus on the process, on discovering and exploring new ideas, and on our growth.
