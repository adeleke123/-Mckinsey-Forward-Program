## Framing our intentions
Do you ever feel you are working through an endless to-do list, often losing sight of the destination and why it matters? Or that you are responding on autopilot, going through the motions, but perhaps missing opportunities to learn, grow, and adapt? You’re not alone.

Surprisingly, the most adaptable people are not those who set the most intentions but those who frame their intentions in the right way. We can frame our intentions in two specific, subtle ways to improve our ability to learn and the likelihood that we’ll enjoy the experience.

### Focus on the journey
Prioritize the learning experience itself by framing your desired outcome as a learning intention rather than a performance goal. Research shows that this can help people persist and expand their learning more than if they started with a performance goal.

### Link to meaning
Connect your learning experience to something personally meaningful. Research shows that personal meaning can give people a feeling of self-direction, increasing their enjoyment, interest, and excitement during learning.
