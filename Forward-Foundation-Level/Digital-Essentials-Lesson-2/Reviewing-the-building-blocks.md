## Strategic Roadmap

It’s important to understand why digital is critical as an organization works to achieve its goals. This includes a compelling vision and a feasible roadmap towards that vision.

## People and skills

Becoming digital requires new capabilities. Organizations may be able to hire new people with the right skills, but they can often help current employees master those skills or learn to do things differently.

## New ways of working

New ways of working enable faster and more user-centered work. These new approaches can include creating teams with a range of expertise who collaborate closely on frequent cycles of testing and improvement.

## Technology

Technology is the backbone of digital. Modern technology enables better user experience and faster launches of new products and features. Technological tools for communication, collaboration, and connection also enable new ways of working.

## Data

Organizations with clear strategies and processes for handling data can use analytics to unlock significant insights. Data should be accessible so that everyone in the organization can use it to make better decisions.

## Adoption and scaling

The full value of digital is achieved only when digital is embedded in the entire organization.
