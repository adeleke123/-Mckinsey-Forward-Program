SPEAKER: Let's take a look at how one company started their digital transformation. Uno Soda makes and distributes natural sodas. They want to achieve new growth by responding more quickly to changes in consumer taste and increased competition. The leaders of the company have created a roadmap for digital transformation that starts with the Marketing group, which has the most potential to increase revenue quickly.

Several initiatives have been identified in the Marketing group, and teams have been assigned. The first team will be working on the Rocket initiative led by Aaliyah. Team Rocket will design and implement a digital solution to increase direct-to-consumer marketing and sales. The team will include people with a cross-functional skill set from marketing, IT, sales, manufacturing, and logistics.

Team Rocket is just the beginning. Throughout the company, cross-functional teams will be formed to digitize all aspects of Uno Soda's business to fulfill its vision of becoming the leading natural soda company in the country.
