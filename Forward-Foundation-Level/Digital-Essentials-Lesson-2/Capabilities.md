## Capabilities

Before it can make its strategic vision a reality, Uno Soda needs to assess its capabilities. You might remember from the previous course that data, technology, and new ways of working are important, but progress is only possible with people who can implement the changes. Together, these building blocks are most likely to affect your day-to-day work experience.

## How does Uno Soda invest in people to meet digital needs?

An organization can succeed only with the right people and skills. Uno Soda can bring in outside expertise or hire new people with specific skills, but it can also help existing employees acquire new skills—for example by providing training like this.

## How can Uno Soda adopt ways of working that best meet customer needs?

Many companies go digital because they need to become more user-centric. Both design thinking and Agile methodology require teams to gain a deep understanding of user needs. For Uno Soda, that can mean establishing frequent feedback cycles with target customers. To respond quickly to that feedback, Uno Soda will also need to create cross-functional teams that work in fast development cycles.

## How can Uno Soda modernize technology without disruption?

Replacing every older legacy system at the same time can be disruptive and prohibitively expensive, so many companies bridge older systems with targeted modern technologies. Off-the-shelf technologies can provide solutions that aren’t perfect but are good enough to get started. Uno Soda’s IT department might even decide to build their software in the cloud. In any case, the team will want impact in months rather than years.

## How can everyone access data that helps them do their jobs better ?

What if everyone at Uno Soda could access the data they needed to diagnose problems, anticipate risks and opportunities, and make more informed decisions? Advances in data-gathering and analysis make this increasingly possible, but Uno Soda will need to create a data-driven culture to drive adoption and scale-up.
