## Adaptability and Resilience

Setting Learning Intentions
In today's world, adaptability and resilience are not just about persevering through challenges and setbacks. As the pace of disruption increases, we need to befriend and harness change. That requires consistent learning, which is both more difficult and more important in times of change.

Whether we are improving specific skills or making big changes in our lives, the first step is to set learning intentions. Research shows that this can boost our desire and ability to learn, and make us more persistent. Setting intentions not only makes it more likely that the learning will happen, it also makes it more likely that you will enjoy yourself in the process.
