## Common misconceptions

Although the individual actions of the REACH model might seem straightforward, bringing them to life can be challenging. One reason is because there are a few common misunderstandings about what it means to have a psychologically safe environment. Once these ideas are more clear, you are likely to see even more opportunities for building psychological safety.

** Flip each card to debunk the misconception.

`cat Psychological safety means no conflict or challenges. It means everyone is nice. Sometimes being nice may require a bit of self-censoring.` 
```
In fact, psychologically safe teams frequently ask challenging questions. 
They listen deeply, and understand that—for them to respect the speaker and 
team—they have an obligation to suggest other points of view. Therefore, 
they say “I don’t agree” the most, even if it’s with the senior team member. 
Those who face disagreement, in turn, look forward to having their ideas challenged and improved.

The whole team sees the benefit of sparking a great discussion that will improve outcomes.

While some people define “being nice” as agreeing in a meeting and 
then criticizing in private, psychologically safe teams do the opposite:
they openly disagree with each other to eventually reach a truly agreed-upon solution.
```
`Psychological safety means every little decision is discussed from every possible angle. 
It’s hard to be efficient because teams are stuck in endless meetings before decisions are made.`

```
In fact, psychologically safe teams tend to call out inefficient meetings because 
they are not afraid they will insult the meeting organizer or current speaker. 
They are also fine with leaders who make decisions unilaterally, 
if those leaders have collected input from the team first. 

They are also okay saying, “This decision isn’t as critical as others, and 
doesn’t require team discussion time. We trust one team member to figure it out.”

```


`Psychological safety means no accountability, no performance focus, and—ultimately— unproductive teams.`

```
In fact, research consistently shows that psychologically safe teams perform better. 
One reason is likely that they don’t fear risk and failure as much. 
They may also be more transparent about their work, 
frequently accepting suggestions, and giving them. 
Transparent teams also generally set higher performance goals, and 
work together more collaboratively to reach them.

That said, it is also critical for managers to avoid relaxing performance goals 
while teams reach psychological safety. Doing so may send employees 
into what researcher Amy Edmondson calls the “comfort zone” 
where accountability and performance may suffer while everyone feels good. 
Instead, they should strive to be in the “learning zone,” 
which combines both high performance targets and psychological safety.
