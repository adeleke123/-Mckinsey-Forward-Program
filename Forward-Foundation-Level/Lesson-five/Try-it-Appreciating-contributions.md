Two of your team members have worked hard over the past couple of weeks preparing two different proposals for the head of your business unit. You thought both projects turned out fantastic, and the two project leads—Mariko and Omran—both exceeded your expectations. You were initially sure the BU head would feel the same way, but you just heard back that only Mariko’s proposal was approved.

+ Mariko, congratulations on your proposal. This is a great result and I am excited to see the project come to life. Omran, it’s a shame your proposal wasn’t approved because I know you worked really hard. Let’s learn and grow from the experience and improve for next time.

+ It is clear how hard both of you worked. You took real risks, and suggested ideas we knew might be controversial. Mariko, I am looking forward to seeing how your creative ideas will come to life. Omran, you did a great job of involving stakeholders and incorporating their feedback. Given that the business unit has just decided to revisit some of our strategic assumptions, this is not the right time to fund this proposal. But you laid the groundwork and built relationships that will help us in the future. Thank you for leading the way.

+ I am so proud of our team. Mariko, congratulations—this was an important proposal, and the fact that it’s funded reflects well on all of us. Thank you for your hard work.
