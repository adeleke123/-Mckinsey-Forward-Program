## How do we create psychological safety?

Psychological safety empowers people to fully contribute their unique talents and perspectives. When this happens, team members can do their best work, and learn and perform better, all while reducing stress.

So what does it take to create the space for teams to feel psychologically safe and do their best work? It depends on the actions each team member takes to help teammates feel comfortable speaking up and taking risks, without fearing consequences. We can use the four actions of the REACH model to guide us. These actions build on a foundation of awareness and strong relationships.
