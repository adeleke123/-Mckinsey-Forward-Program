## Try it: Coaching other team members to help and support each other

Jonas, one of your team members, comes to you, visibly frustrated, and starts complaining about how another team member messed up: “I am a little fed up. Sam never seems to get things right the first time, and I am always left to fix his mistakes.”

+ You seem frustrated, Jonas, and I am sorry you are feeling that way. I have felt that way in the past, too. Don’t worry though, it happens to all of us—there’s usually someone on the team who is not quite meeting expectations.
+ That does sound frustrating, Jonas. What do you think is going on with Sam? In the past, he’s been pretty reliable, so maybe he’s not aware of these mistakes. Or maybe he is, and he’s feeling frustrated, too. Maybe there are other challenges and he needs help, but doesn't know how to ask for it. Have you explored this with him?
+ I would be frustrated, too, Jonas. Since this is a repeated pattern, I think you need to bring this up directly with Sam. It’s not fair to him if you don’t give him the feedback, and let him know that you’re tired of fixing his mistakes. You need to be open with him.
+ That is frustrating, Jonas, I know. It does seem like Sam is struggling. Do you think you might need to be more clear about your own expectations?
