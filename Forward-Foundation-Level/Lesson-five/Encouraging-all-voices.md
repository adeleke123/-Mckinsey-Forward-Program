## Encouraging all voices

A recent study found that the most important factor in creating psychological safety culture is “team voice”—the ability of team members to give input into how the team carries out its actions. For example, a team has strong "team voice" if members frequently and openly share their ideas for potential innovation, their solutions to problems, and their views on risks and priorities.

Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Have you ever experienced a team meeting where most of the team sat silently? Maybe they were nodding in agreement, even if they did not actually agree. Strong team voice means everyone speaks up, because they realize that their contributions will help the team and they feel that they will be listened to.

## How can we encourage all voices?

### What good looks like

+ Every time there’s a big decision, explicitly ask, “Are we ready to move forward?” and make sure everyone says “yes.”
+ Avoid using discrediting language when somebody shares (e.g., avoid saying thing like “yes, but … “ or “There is a lot of context you don’t know.”).

### What great looks like

+ Actively avoid the “sunflower” effect, where others align with the view of the leader.
+ Remind the team frequently of the power of having everyone share. Note that, in our complex world, leaders don’t have all the answers, and that everyone has a unique and useful part of the answer.
+ Invite participation in neutral, non-threatening ways (e.g., “What could be a viewpoint we are missing?”) and pause long enough for people to speak up.
+ Set up formal team mechanisms to encourage sharing of ideas (e.g., have a standing “devil’s advocate meeting” to pressure-test plans and ideas).
+ Fill silences with questions instead of comments.
+ Explain why certain points of view were not incorporated into a final decision; share context and the decision-making process with the team transparently.
