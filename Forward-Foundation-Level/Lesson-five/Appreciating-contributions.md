## Appreciating contributions

An attitude of gratitude goes a long way toward building a psychologically safe team. However, we also need to move beyond just celebrating achievements like a great idea or finished product, and also value the many actions that contribute to the team process. This includes valuing our mistakes, and learning from them. It includes being willing to have difficult conversations, asking hard questions, and seeking help when we need it. The more that team members feel their contributions are valued, the more likely they are to keep engaging.

## How can we appreciate contributions?

### What good looks like

+ Proactively and frequently acknowledge the good job that team members are doing.
+ Say “thank you” when people speak up, or go above and beyond the norm.

### What great looks like

+ Make recognition part of your team’s language and norms.
+ Give special thanks to people who bring up uncomfortable, hard issues.
+ Be specific about any action that you celebrate, and the impact it had on you.
+ Acknowledge the points that others make during a meeting (e.g., “To build on Cara’s point...).
