## How you frame your learning intention matters
It is easy to get into the trap of setting performance goals when we should be setting learning intentions. So what exactly is the difference? The distinction can feel subtle, but significant impact comes from knowing when to apply each.

+ `Performance goals` are what they sound like—goals to hit certain numbers or achieve a particular target. They are helpful when there is something specific we want to achieve and we have already learned the skills or knowledge we need to achieve it.
+ `Learning intentions`, on the other hand, are most useful when it’s time to build new skills and knowledge, especially when we are adapting to changes that challenge us to do things differently.

Imagine a skill acquisition spectrum which spans from being a complete novice to the point of true mastery.

When you encounter a new task or challenge, something you don't know how to tackle yet, first set a learning intention. For example, to experiment with a new project management tool, or even learn to play a new instrument. In these early stages of learning, you shouldn't fixate on how well you're doing. Instead, focus on the quality of your learning.

Often, when you decide to take up a new skill, you may set performance goals too early in the process. And when you fail to achieve them, you feel overwhelmed and even give up. But don't fall in that trap.

Take Paola. She loves playing the piano, and her dream is to perform La Campanella, one of the hardest piano compositions to this day. So she sets a learning intention—learn how to play La Campanella. Because before she can consider setting a performance goal like receiving a standing ovation from a live audience, she will need to practice with purpose and focus in order to develop the dexterity and speed skills required to perform such a piece. Once you practiced sufficiently and continue to develop your skills, you can then apply your learning and introduce performance goals.

In the workplace the distinction between setting a learning intention and performance goal would look something like this. Increase sales revenue by 10% this year is a performance goal. It's not something you would set unless you were already competent in your sales skills.

This is where starting with a learning intention would help. For example, taking the time to deepen your expertise about one of your company's new offerings, or practicing your customer talking points with colleagues. With that solid foundation, you'll be equipped to eventually meet the challenge of a performance goal. Whether it's La Campanella or something much simpler, you'll know you are ready to perform when you feel excited to demonstrate what you've learned. And if you find yourself somewhere in between on the learning spectrum, you can set a mix of learning intentions and performance goals.

In our rapidly changing world, there is an increasing number of opportunities to grow and learn. Whether you find yourself exploring new roles or taking on new responsibilities as part of your existing role, you will set yourself up for long term performance and success when you start by setting learning intentions.

### Did you know?

Neuroscience confirms that exploration and curiosity feel great—so setting and working on a learning intention should be fun! Focusing on a performance goal too early can short-circuit your learning and slow you down, taking attention and energy away from the learning that will enable you to perform in the long term.

Psychology studies show that when participants are given something new to learn, focusing on the journey rather than the outcome appears to improve both enjoyment and attention, two things associated with high-quality learning. If you find yourself framing learning as a burdensome investment that pays off later, try to flip your thinking and focus on enjoying the learning itself, right now.
