## Setting learning intentions

## What are your learning intentions?

As you begin the course, take a few minutes to reflect on your own personal communication experiences. Setting a learning intention can be most useful when building new skills and knowledge. Download the CFI Learning Intentions workbook to do so! You will revisit this workbook throughout the course. This will allow you to track your intentions and save them as a takeaway at the end of the course.

Consider the four elements of the EPIC approach to communications:

Empathy: put yourself in the other personâ€™s shoes to understand their perspective
Purpose: define the purpose to include their needs and yours
Insight: articulate your ideas in a clear and compelling way
Conversation: plan and orchestrate the flow of an effective two-way conversation
Write 3-5 sentences describing a situation where you did a great job communicating. Diagnose which part of EPIC you did well. For example, did you make a strong emotional connection with your audience?

Then, write 3-5 sentences describing a situation where you faced challenges communicating. Which part of EPIC might have helped you in the moment?

You can choose a professional or personal context. Give concrete examples of each situation and, most importantly, be honest with yourself!
