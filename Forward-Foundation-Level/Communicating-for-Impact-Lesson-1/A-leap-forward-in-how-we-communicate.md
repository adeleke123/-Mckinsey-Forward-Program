## A leap forward in how we communicate


## The EPIC approach to communications

To deliver change that matters to your audience, it is not enough to simply bring great ideas and insights. You must communicate those ideas in a way that inspires people to act and to implement meaningful change. Moving people to action isn’t easy—it requires a lot of skill and practice. But the EPIC framework will help you get there.

EPIC is a holistic approach to communication that is applicable to a wide range of interactions, team situations, and your everyday life. It will help you forge deeper connections, align on a common purpose, and inspire action for significant change.

Do you pause to ask yourself questions before each interaction? Most of us don’t—we usually launch into what we want to say, for better or worse. But EPIC reminds us to pause and ask the important questions.

Flip each card to learn about the key questions to ask yourself under each element of EPIC.
