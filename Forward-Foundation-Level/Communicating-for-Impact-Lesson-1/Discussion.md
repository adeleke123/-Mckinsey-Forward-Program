## Which speakers do you find inspiring?

Before we explore the EPIC framework, which can help guide your interactions, think about speakers that you have found inspiring. Some presentations are simply unforgettable. We want to hear about them!

* Discussion

Visit the discussion forum to answer the following questions or to respond to someone else’s answer. You’ll get the most out of the course experience by reading and responding to each other’s posts.

Identify a speaker that inspired you. You can select a historical or present day figure from any arena, for example, politics, business, or entertainment. You can even refer to a presentation or speech by a peer or friend.
Put the name of the speaker in the title of your post, describe why he or she inspired you, and comment on the techniques that speaker used to move his or her audience to action. Whenever possible, post a link that showcases the speaker’s performance.
What was the result of the presentation? What action was taken?
