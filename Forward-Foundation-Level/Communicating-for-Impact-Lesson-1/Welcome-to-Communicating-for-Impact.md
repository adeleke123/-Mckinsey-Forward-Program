## Welcome to Communicating for Impact


The goals of the course are to help you move people to action based on four key steps of the EPIC approach to communications:

Empathy

Put yourself in the other person’s shoes to understand their perspective

Purpose

Define the purpose to include their needs and yours

Insight

Articulate your ideas in a clear and compelling way

Conversation

Plan and orchestrate the flow of an effective two-way conversation

These steps can be applied to any communications and, with practice, can be applied to both quick daily interactions and more extensive communications planning.

In this course, you’ll benefit from the expertise of McKinsey faculty member Kate Aquila and a diverse set of McKinsey experts from around the world. You will also be introduced to other tools and frameworks throughout the course to help reinforce EPIC.
