KATE AQUILA: I'm Kate Aquila. I'm a Communications Expert at McKinsey, and I work with our clients to help them become more effective communicators with their organizations. This is especially important in the midst of important organizational change. Communicating for Impact is a course designed to help professionals build a well-rounded set of communication skills that are critical to being effective in the business world. And over several weeks, participants will really see a difference in their ability to have impact.

Throughout this course, I will be leading participants through an EPIC journey of how to become more effective communicators. Participants will hear a lot from me throughout the course, and I'll be joined by a phenomenal group of my fellow experts and senior partners from around the firm who will share their perspectives on what it takes to be an effective communicator. It is a highly interactive course that enables participants to learn and practice the tools, as well as reflect on their own experiences.

There are activities and prompts, such as try it now or take it to your team, simulations, and other opportunities to engage in discussion boards with other participants. We are also going to be joined by a set of animated characters who are going through their own communication challenges. We will be joined by Aaliyah, Noah, and Maryam. They face their own unique communication challenges in their workplace.

Communicating for impact, to me, is really about how good communication can affect and change the world. Good communication is important because it enables us to express our ideas in a clear and compelling way and move people to action. Becoming an effective communicator is both an art and a science. It is a learnable skill. I would say that, for participants, the best approach is to keep an open and curious mind throughout the course.

Be flexible, try something new, get out of your comfort zone a bit, and then take a moment to pause and reflect on the tools and concepts and how you can apply them in your own personal experience. By the end of this course, participants will learn the EPIC framework and know how to apply it to any interaction. They will be equipped with the tools and techniques to flexibly move between different situations, where effective communication is critical.

Whether it is in the year 340 BCE or the year 2040 in the Common Era, the principles of impactful communication apply. Throughout history, people have communicated with impact on cave walls, on papyrus and at amphitheaters, in senates, in boardrooms, in cubicles, in person, and virtually. What unites great communicators throughout history and in the present day is their ability to connect with their audience, create a sense of purpose, craft a message that is clear and compelling, and deliver it in a memorable way.

Our intention with this course is to help everyone become more effective communicators. While the context is the business world that participants operate in, the principles we teach are applicable to communicating in all aspects of life. Practicing in everyday life builds your confidence and capabilities so that when the big moments arrive, you are ready to take on the challenge.
