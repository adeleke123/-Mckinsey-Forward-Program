## User personas and user journeys

### User personas

Designers use qualitative data to create user personas. User personas are distilled from the thoughts and observations of many end users. Each persona includes a name and often a picture, along with statements that describe their feelings and preferences.

User personas help designers empathize with end users. The goal is to uncover users’ needs and really understand the choices they make.

### User journeys

User personas can help us envision a user’s experience interacting with a service or product. That experience is called a user journey. The user journey tracks key moments before, during, and after the user selects and uses the product or service. This helps designers pinpoint “moments that matter” and opportunities to design experiences that the user needs and wants.

The Uno Soda team constructed this user journey to understand their customer’s online shopping experience.
