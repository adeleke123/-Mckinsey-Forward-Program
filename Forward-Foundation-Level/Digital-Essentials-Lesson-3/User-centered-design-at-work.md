## Painless system updates

A smartphone maker captured customer experiences from diverse sources, including social media and online chat rooms. Their research showed that users wanted a two-way dialogue during system updates, especially when something went wrong.

## Easy-to-find help

A major department store noticed low customer satisfaction in their discount stores. Customer and employee interviews revealed that customers were struggling to find associates while shopping. Designers responded with a T-shirt initiative; salespeople wore brightly colored T-shirts so customers could easily identify them.

The results? In two days the company saw a 30-point increase in satisfaction.
