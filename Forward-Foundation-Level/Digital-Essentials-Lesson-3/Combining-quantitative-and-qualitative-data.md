## Combining quantitative and qualitative data

The Uno Soda team had to combine quantitative and qualitative data to get a more accurate picture of their customers. This is very common! Design thinking uses both kinds of data to develop a deep understanding of what end users want and need.

## Quantitative data

Quantitative data can help us understand what end users do. Numbers can show who the users are, and the actions they take. We often start with quantitative data to learn whom to interview and what questions to ask them.

## Qualitative data

Qualitative data can help us understand why users do things or what they would prefer to do if they had more choices. Those insights help us “tell the story” of what end users want and need, so we can create a delightful experience.
