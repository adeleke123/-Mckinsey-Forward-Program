## What is user-centered design?

Traditional design starts with a product or service in mind. Designers begin by imagining an ideal solution.

User-centered design starts with the end user in mind. Designers begin by researching users and documenting their experiences in user journeys. Those journeys inform solutions that surprise and delight the user.

MAHIN SAMADANI: There were a couple of folks in 2007 that saw an opportunity to disrupt the taxicab industry. And they went about doing it from a top-down standpoint. They had relationships in the cab industry. They created a solution that was well-suited to the drivers, dispatchers. And it helped automate a lot of the dispatch process. What they left out was thinking about what would work best for the rider, for the customer. So that company was called Taxi Magic. And no one's really heard of them.

And two years later, in 2009, there were two folks in Paris that needed a car. They decided to think about what would really suit us well. What's the ultimate solution for a passenger, for a rider? And they thought, well, wouldn't it be great if you could see where the car was, if when you got out, you just paid your tab by closing the door. And that company's called Uber. That really marks the difference between focusing completely on the customer versus thinking about the business.
