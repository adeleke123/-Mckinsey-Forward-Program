## Try your hand at experience design

The user journey helped the Uno Soda team see their customers’ pain points. Customers enjoyed taking the online survey but were frustrated when they couldn’t change the flavors that the website recommended. Some even gave up and left the site.

This is the moment when the design phase begins. The team will use what they’ve learned to generate ideas and design a better experience. What ideas do you have?

How could Uno Soda improve the customer’s experience?

In the space below, write one way that Uno Soda could improve the survey and recommendation experience.

As you work on your idea, ask yourself:

+ What happens if the customer does not like the recommendations?
+ What if the customer wants to swap out a flavor?
+ How many times can a customer take the survey?
