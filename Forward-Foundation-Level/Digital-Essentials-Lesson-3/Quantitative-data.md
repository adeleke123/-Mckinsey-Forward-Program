## Quantitative data
Amar, Aaliyah, and Janna can’t make a recommendation based on the quantitative data alone. By the numbers, cola is currently by far Uno’s biggest seller. But sales of “other” flavors are growing fast, as are online sales. In other words, the right path isn’t clear. That’s because the data shows customers’ current behavior and give signs of what’s trending. But they don’t reveal what customers will want or need in the future—or why.

So, why should the team look at any quantitative data? Because the data sparks ideas and questions to pursue.

For example:

+ The data shows that cola is the most popular flavor. Why?
+ Interest in “other” flavors is growing. What flavors are young consumers looking for?
+ Online sales are trending up. Why are more young consumers buying soda online?
+ To get answers to these questions, Amar, Aaliyah, and Janna need qualitative data.


## Qualitative data is not measurable; rather they give descriptive information. For example, qualitative data can give designers insights into what end users like and dislike, the challenges they face, and what they want and need from a product or service. Designers typically gather qualitative data through interviews and observations.

Amar, Aaliyah, and Janna interviewed 15 natural soda drinkers ages 20-34. Common themes and answers are below.
