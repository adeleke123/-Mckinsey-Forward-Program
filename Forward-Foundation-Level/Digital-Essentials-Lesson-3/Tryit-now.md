You’ve learned the basics of design thinking using the Uno Soda case, and you’ve seen how it can be applied to almost any role. Now, think about an opportunity to use design thinking in your own work.

How could you improve your end user’s experience?
Download your Design Thinking workbook and go to the exercise entitled “How could you improve your end users’ experience?” In the space provided, describe a challenge end users face when using your product or service. Then, jot down three ways you could address that challenge.

As you work on your idea, ask yourself:

+ What have you observed or heard from customers that made you realize this is a challenge?
+ What’s an easy way to address the challenge?
+ If you could do a full redesign, what would you do?
