## The design thinking process

User-centered design doesn’t “just happen.” It is the product of a three-phase process called design thinking.

Each phase of the design thinking process prioritizes the needs and wants of the user. Designers do research, conduct tests, and gather feedback from users in a cycle of continuous improvement.

`Discover`
```
In this stage, we focus on customer research. We might:

Review quantitative data, such as industry reports and statistics
Interview, survey, or observe end users to better understand their needs, challenges, desires, and contexts

```

`Deliver`

```
In this phase, we implement, typically in short, iterative cycles that allow us to get feedback from users and refine our approaches. We should:

Define achievable, measurable goals
Use small-scale launches such as pilots or beta testing to gain new insights
Continuously improve the design

```

`Design`

```
In this phase, we generate and test ideas. We use prototypes and models to:

Collect feedback from users and refine our approach
Rapidly identify critical risks and challenges
Uncover incorrect assumptions
Validate and improve the design

```
