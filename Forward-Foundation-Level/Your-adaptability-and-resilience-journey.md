## Your adaptability and resilience journey
Like Michelle, every day we have a chance to practice adaptability: to see challenges as opportunities, to keep going when things are hard, and to respond positively to the changes around us.

Here is the good news: you already know how to do this! You have been learning, growing, and adapting since birth. According to research, adaptability is not a trait; it is a state, which you can develop through practice. In challenging times, being adaptable and resilient reduces our stress, improves our relationships, allows us to make better decisions, and makes our work more rewarding. There is no better time than now to continue building your resilience, like a muscle that gets stronger with time and use.

This course will cover the areas research shows move the needle the most on individual adaptability and resilience. We hope what you learn and practice here will make you be more effective in your current role, future-proof your career, and—hopefully—make living in our fast-paced world more enjoyable.
