Welcome
Dear Forward learners,

Welcome to the first set of lessons in your program and your first milestone to complete: our Adaptability and Resilience signature offering.

We started the Forward journey with these lessons because over the last few years, we have been living in times of unprecedented uncertainty and the only constant is change. Even before COVID-19, the rapidly increasing pace of change, combined with strenuous working norms was putting incredible pressure on us all. This means that we must embrace new skills and tools that can help us keep up with this rapidly increasing pace of change - we must adapt.

Adaptability is in demand—our research along with others indicate it is consistently a top skill desired by employers. However, only 10% of companies have any sort of skill building in this area at all, and it is largely reserved for executive audiences. This sets out to change that.

We conducted intensive research on why some individuals are adaptable and others aren’t. We found that, contrary to the belief of some, you can learn to be more adaptable—and there are a specific set of behaviors and mindsets that get you there. This journey is built to share those with you in a way that is consistent with the learning science McKinsey Academy is known for.

We hope you enjoy and, more critically, that you find this helps you be more of who you want to be as a leader.

Sincerely,

The Forward Team

In our lives, change is unavoidable, loss is unavoidable. In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change, lies our happiness and freedom.
