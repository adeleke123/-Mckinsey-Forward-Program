## New ways of working
The third component of going digital is introducing new ways of working. Changing how we work helps us use technology and data to collaborate, take smarter risks, and test ideas faster—all to better meet people’s needs. Next, we’ll explore new ways of working such as design thinking and Agile.

## What is design thinking?
Design thinking is a way of working focused on addressing the needs of users or customers. It allows us to solve problems in a creative and innovative way. It begins with a deep understanding of our end users and the problems they face. An “end user” is any person who will use the product or service we create. Based on that understanding, we can design products or services to meet those needs better.
