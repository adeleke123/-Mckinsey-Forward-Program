## Technology

New technologies, such as cloud, artificial intelligence, and connected devices, help us solve problems at home and at work. The same technologies that improve our personal lives also help companies, non-profits, and governments serve their stakeholders better.

The cloud is on-demand computing power and data storage, accessed through the internet. Organizations that outsource their IT infrastructure to the cloud are able to scale their data and processing capacity up or down as needs change. Modern applications and business services based in the cloud allow multiple people in different locations to work on the same document simultaneously.

Flip the cards for examples.
