## How does digital help organizations?

Many of the benefits of digital that you enjoy at home apply in the workplace. Organizations founded in the last 10 to 20 years typically use digital as default approaches to achieving their missions. They are sometimes known as “digital natives.”

Other organizations are adopting new technology, learning how to use data, and changing how they work in order to go digital. Regardless of where your organization is in the process of going digital, understanding the benefits will help you see the opportunities ahead.

`Digital helps you harness the power of data to make better decisions more quickly and create more impact.
Using data to make decisions`

+ Medical researchers often struggle to match patients with clinical trials. Artificial intelligence can help save time and money. After AI algorithms comb through clinical trial requirements, software translates the data to help patients decide whether they are a suitable fit.


`Digital helps you focus on the parts of your job you find most important.
Automating repetitive tasks`

+ Automation makes it easier for public library patrons to check out and return materials, freeing librarians to do more for the community, such as provide additional services, help people conduct research, and offer more educational programming.

`Digital helps you collaborate better and design more seamless processes.
Accelerating processes`

+ An airline uses artificial intelligence to scan cargo shipments. It sends the data to the finance team, who use it to invoice customers, freeing the cargo team to focus on more nuanced tasks. The artificial intelligence also spots mistakes in invoices and allows customer service to proactively reach out to customers who need help.
`Digital helps you innovate how you work.`
Innovating new solutions for maintenance needs

+ A major steel manufacturer designed a digital system that combines existing data with new data gathered from sensors on equipment to improve worker safety and shift production processes quickly based on demand, quality, and maintenance status. The system also identifies defects and predicts maintenance needs, reducing rework, downtime, and repair costs. Ways of working in the factory also changed: quality control engineers now spend more time improving products and less time analyzing data to find the causes of defects.


## Creating value
All of these benefits increase an organization’s value—monetary and non-monetary. Digital can improve the customer experience and employee satisfaction, while it increases sales and reduces costs and risks. Digital can dramatically reduce manual work, giving staff and the organization more resources to innovate and delight customers.
