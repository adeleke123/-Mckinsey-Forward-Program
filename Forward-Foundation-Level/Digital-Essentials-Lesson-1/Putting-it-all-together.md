## Putting it all together

The most successful digital organizations drive change using all the elements we’ve discussed so far. They demonstrate that digital is about much more than technology:

Digital is the combination of data, technology, and ways of working that help individuals and organizations automate, connect, innovate, and make better decisions. Digital helps organizations better meet the needs and enhance the experiences of customers, consumers, and employees.

Next, you’ll see how one agricultural machinery manufacturer used digital to amplify its competitive advantage and impact.

As the global population rises, the agricultural industry needs to grow more food on limited land while reducing costs and improving sustainability. John Deere was founded almost 200 years ago to make and sell farm equipment. In recent years, however, company leaders realized that selling more of the same equipment would not help farmers do more with less. They changed their business strategy to integrate advanced technologies into farm vehicles, enabling farmers’ longer-term success.

John Deere’s first step was to gain a deeper understanding of the needs of farmers, their customers. Farmers deal with enormous uncertainties in the weather, market conditions, and other factors. John Deere aimed to reduce that uncertainty by giving farmers simpler ways to collect, understand, and use data


The company added sensors to its machines that analyzed weather forecasts and data on soil conditions, seed properties, and other information critical to farmers’ day-to-day decisions.



John Deere amplified benefits to farmers with cameras, cloud technology, and artificial intelligence. Data from smart cameras was automatically uploaded to the cloud, where farmers could evaluate crop quality in real time and collaborate with other farmers to get advice on what to plant and where, how much fertilizer to use, and so on. As the machines gathered more data, more farmers benefited, so the company could use AI and machine learning to find previously unseen patterns and improve their products.



## Why was John Deere successful?

This solution was possible only because John Deere focused keenly on the needs of farmers. The company developed the technology to capture and analyze data and built equipment that farmers needed. The new strategy helped the company deliver more value to shareholders and enabled farmers to produce more food more efficiently.
