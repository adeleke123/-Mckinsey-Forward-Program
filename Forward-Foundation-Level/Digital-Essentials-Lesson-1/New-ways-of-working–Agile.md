## Agile ways of working

Once you’ve identified the right problems and have a deeper understanding of your end user, what are the best ways to create and test your ideas? Agile includes principles and methodologies that help organizations respond rapidly to changing conditions. At the core of Agile are “sprints,” short cycles that speed innovation.

* Reflection


To illustrate why new ways of working are important, think back to a time when you collaborated on a complex project. You might have experienced some of these problems:

+ I didn’t get much feedback along the way, so I had to redo a lot of work.
+ The criteria for success kept changing.
+ I wasted a lot of time trying to get permissions or sign-offs.
+ The team didn’t have the right expertise to solve the problem.



+ What challenges did you experience on the project? How did it impact your experience and the final results?
