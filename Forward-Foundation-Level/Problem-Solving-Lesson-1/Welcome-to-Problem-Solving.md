## Welcome to Problem Solving

As a busy professional, you encounter—and solve—problems every day. Your ability to solve problems and make sound decisions is central to your effectiveness on the job. But chances are you've never been taught how to solve problems. You likely figured out how to do it on your own and by watching others.

### Have you ever taken a step back to reflect on how you solve problems?

+ `Actions`: What steps do you take?
+ `Stakeholders`: Whom do you involve?
+ `Approach`: How do you adjust for different sorts of problems?
+ `Toolkit`: Which resources do you use?
+ `Strengths`: What do you do well?
+ `Opportunities`: How might you improve?

### What you’ll learn

As you move through the six sections of the course, you’ll learn how to take a more structured approach to solving problems, no matter their size or how much time you have to solve them.

### `In Sections 1 and 2`, you will:

+ Explore the importance and relevance of problem-solving skills
+ Learn about five structured approaches to problem solving, with a focus on a hypothesis-led, seven-step approach

### `In Sections 3, 4, and 5`, you'll learn to use the hypothesis-led approach to:

+ Define a problem in a way that best positions the problem-solving effort for success
+ Structure a problem to explore the range of possible issues and then prioritize your focus
+ Arrive at a recommendation through carefully planned work, targeted analyses, synthesis, and appropriate, actionable recommendations

### `In Section 6`, you will:

+ Reflect on your learnings and plan to apply what you’ve learned on the job

### How you’ll learn
Guided by McKinsey faculty Marc Metakis and Emily Yueh, along with McKinsey colleagues and alumni, you will:

+ Be introduced to problem-solving tools and techniques you can try right away
+ Practice applying concepts, tools and techniques in a series of case studies
+ Hear insights and practical advice
+ Practice quick, targeted “try it now” and “take it to your team” activities to immediately apply what you’ve learned to your work and share what you’re learning with colleagues
