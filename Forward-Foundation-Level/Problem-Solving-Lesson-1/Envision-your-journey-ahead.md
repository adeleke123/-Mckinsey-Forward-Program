## Introduction

### Welcome to the McKinsey Forward Foundation Level

Congratulations on joining the McKinsey & Company Forward program.

This section will give you an overview of the Foundation Level and a sneak peek into what awaits you in the Advanced Level.

To prepare yourself for the program, please explore the different sections from the menu on the right:

+ `Watch the program overview video`, which will give you an overview of the program, the skills you will learn and the exciting content that await you in the Foundation Level and beyond.
+ `Download your Foundation Level Handbook`. Please read the handbook carefully. This handbook is designed to serve as a canvas for you to capture ideas, reflections, and insights during and after the program. In the handbook, you will also find more details of each module of the program, along with information about qualifying for the Advanced Level.
+ `Sign up for a Welcome Webinar` where you will meet the McKinsey Forward team, other program participants, and ask any questions you may have.
You can also review the `How To Guide and Foundation Level FAQs` documents found in the Learning Materials library which you can access from your homepage and in the welcome email that you have received from the Forward team. These documents will help you navigate this platform easily and answer some of the most common questions.

Finally, please `check your emails regularly` for upcoming communications about deadlines, virtual events, and other announcements.
