Great problem solvers are made, not born. Leveraging the input of others is a hallmark of great problem solving

`INGRID`: I'm Ingrid. That I'm a partner in our D.C. office. As you heard from other leaders, problem-solving, or the process by which we make decisions, is a core element of leadership. So what does great problem-solving look like?

When the problem-solving is OK, you're probably getting to an answer to the problem. It may even be a reasonably good answer. But you're not getting the best answer. And oftentimes, what differentiates the OK versus the great is whether you are leveraging the collective power of the group.

When it's OK, there's often times one individual-- in many cases, the leader of that group solving the problem-- who takes a disproportionate share of the problem-solving burden. They may be imposing their own view on how to structure the problem and go about the analysis. I think the great examples of problem-solving-- it's around how do you get most of everybody involved? And I think one of the tricks as problem-solving leader is to understand how to do that.

If you're in an environment where you're working through a problem with a number of people, it is probably more important to actually formalize and put on a sheet of paper what is our problem? What are the constraints? Who are the stakeholders we need to align? And how we're structuring the problem to enable everybody to eventually agree and align on the approach to get to the right solution.

Conversely, if you're working through a problem and everybody's saying the same things-- it may even be the right answer, but in those cases, as a problem-solving leader, you want to think about how can you push that thinking? Do you want to introduce the concept of a red team and a blue team? Do you want to appoint somebody-- even yourself-- who can work as a devil's advocate to really ensure the idea that you're all thinking is the right answer, or the best one?

Being a collaborative problem-solving leader is great not only to get to the right answer, the best answer one can, or the answer as quickly as possible. It has a second benefit, which is the impact of the collaboration and getting everybody really brought into that solution.
