## How much time do you have?

As a professional, youâ€™re surrounded by problems. How can you begin to make sense of them? One practical differentiator is `how much time you have to grapple with a problem and arrive at a recommendation`.

`MARC`: One way to make sense of the problems you encounter is to think about the problem-solving time horizon.

And I often think about it in three ways. There's problem solving in the moment. There's problem solving where you may have a week or two weeks to come to an answer, and there's problem solving over a longer-term project.

In each of those cases, there are different aspects of the problem-solving process that you might want to focus on. So when you're problem solving in the moment, it's really critical to think about have you defined the problem and thought about all the constraints and the solution set.

You might not have time to actually formally whip out a sheet of paper and go through each of the approaches and tools, but the question is, what thinking you can do to really test it in that moment. Have you really defined the problem? Have you aligned all the stakeholders on that, and have you thought about how the solution space we're looking is scoped.

When you're problem solving in one- to two-weeks, you've got a little more time to do that analysis, but not a lot of time. There can be more things you probably want to look at than you have time to do. And so really in that one- to two-week environment or time horizon, it's thinking about how do you prioritize the issues and the analyses you want to conduct.

When you're thinking about problem solving in terms of a longer-term project, you've got more time. But in those cases, you probably also have more complexity. There's probably a lot of value at stake. And in those cases, you want to think about what is the right way to work plan and think about what are the dependencies, what are the stakeholders you need to align, and what decisions you need to make early in the process that may have knock-on effects later in the project's lifespan.
