## Different ways to characterize a problem

There are many ways to categorize problems. Marc just introduced one practical categorization: the amount of time you have to solve them. Framing problem solving in terms of approximate durations can help you recognize unique challenges and opportunities in different contexts.

In addition to categorizing by problem-solving context, we can consider ways to characterize a problem itself. You'll touch on them throughout the course.

In problem solving, striking the right balance between analytical and conceptual work, and between convergent and divergent phases, is critical to your success. Common barriers to sound problem solving include taking an analytical approach to a problem that requires creative thinking, or spending too much time doing divergent thinking and failing to converge on a tangible solution.

## Analytical problems
Some problems require an answer that is purely analytical or quantitative, such as how much we should spend on each marketing channel.

## Conceptual problems
Other problems are more conceptual or qualitative in nature, such as which marketing messages might resonate most with a particular segment.

Both analytical and conceptual problems arise over a range of time frames. In a long-term problem-solving project, you will likely need to solve both analytical and conceptual aspects of a single problem.


## Convergent problems

Some problems are solved by driving towards a single best answer—they use convergent thinking. Convergent thinking is characterized by:

+ Choosing from among discrete options using deductive logic
+ Quickly prioritizing issues and establishing an in-going hypothesis

## Divergent problems
Some problems are best addressed by opening the solution space to discover new possibilities—they use divergent thinking. Divergent thinking is characterized by:

+ Generating and evaluating a wide range of opportunities
+ Innovative and novel solutions

## Think about how you would characterize each of these problems and situations.

Let’s talk about ideas to improve communication and alignment between your team and our analytics team. I’d like to arrive at a couple of improvements we can make right away.”

How can we change the focus on incremental improvement we’ve talked about for the past decade? What are the ways we can get people to adopt a more growth-oriented mindset over the next three years?”
