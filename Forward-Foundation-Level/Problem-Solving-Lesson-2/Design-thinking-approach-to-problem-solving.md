HYO: Design thinking is all about human-centered design. It starts with a deep understanding of the user or the customer or the person that you're designing for. What are their pain points as they interact with you as a product or a company? What are the opportunities for us to address those pain points? What are some of the nuances and qualitative insights that we can gather from just observing and understanding deeply the needs of a person and then designing around those?

The processes begin with really learning about the user or the customer and then using various methods to synthesize what you've learned. They start with a really broad ideation process or really wide process of inquiry.

We start with a lot of questions and very few answers. And the more we learn as we go, sometimes it's more questions. There's ample opportunity to really understand and ask questions and learn deeply about who we’re designing for, and then go through a method of narrowing down, and prioritizing, and then winnowing on a hypothesis to land at the end concept of our answer.

I can think of a project that I worked on a little while ago with a global bank. They wanted to influence the younger customer base and actually help that customer base better manage their finances. The starting point was pretty wide open – understanding how young people think about money, how they save money, and how they spend money – and then coming up with ideas, however crazy they were at the beginning, to address this.

Long story short is in doing ethnographic research with some of these users or customer types, we learned that little pushes at appropriate times were the things that could influence them the most. So when I'm spending $100 on a pair of shoes, saying, at that moment, “Are you sure you want to spend $100 on those shoes.”

And the building up of all of these little nudges had a great impact. So in the end the solution was not a whole new product that's about personal financial management, but actually a nudge application, where we identified a lot of behavior levers, created nudges, and built this database of nudges that got smarter and smarter and smarter. We could present it in situ, real time, to people via the app as they were spending and saving and making purchases.

It's funny, because when you talk about design thinking, there are words that typically never come up in other consulting conversations, like creating delightful experiences and making products and services that people love or that they can't live without.

In order to arrive at really awesome end products through design thinking, I think the critical and distinctive thing about it is that you must have people with empathy. You have to empathize with the customer or the end user you're working with. Not just understand them from a demographic point of view or from a data intensive point of view, but put yourself in the shoes of that customer and see how they behave, what their motivations are, how other things in their life are influencing them. And that's really how you get to the core of really touching the heart of that customer's needs. So that's what I think is the key difference of design thinking. Yeah.

You know, lately I've been focusing a lot on big, heavy, hairy industrial-sized problems, a lot of business-to-business kind of scenarios. Often, people think that design thinking is just for consumers or retail or things that are very close to you as a consumer. Design thinking is absolutely super powerful when you apply it to complicated internal processes or big manufacturing processes or things that you wouldn't really typically associate with design thinking. So applying design thinking to very complicated processes that involve humans rather than designing for one transaction or one interaction has been a really great new development that I've been focusing on.

What is the Design thinking approach to problem solving?
Discover

Build insights into emotional needs to create impactful experiences; link these experiences to value by establishing a clear relationship to business outcomes.
Key activities include immersive kickoff, research, synthesis of discovery findings, prioritization of opportunity areas.
Design

Create a plan for the construction of an object, system, or measurable human interaction. A plan can consist of architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, or business processes.
Activities include: Immersion in best-in-class examples, initial designs, co-creation for refinement, and feedback.
Deliver

Create a flow of deliverables that help to further define and describe the solution to the problem. This solution can take the form of a digital product, a service, or a physical product.
Activities include: design principles, concept briefs, prototypes, or product concepts, business case.
Typical problems (examples)

Customer value proposition
Product/service innovation
Employee experience
