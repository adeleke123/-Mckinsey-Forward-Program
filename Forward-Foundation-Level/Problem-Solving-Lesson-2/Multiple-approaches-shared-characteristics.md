## Multiple approaches, shared characteristics

Here, youâ€™ll explore five structured problem-solving approaches that, while distinct, share core characteristics in that they are focused on problem definition, impact-oriented, fact-based, and driven by synthesis.

EMILY: So, we've talked a lot about all the different benefits and the power of adopting a structured approach to problem solving. You save more time, you're much more deliberate about your approach, you know exactly where you are in the process. There are many other benefits but I'm curious, Marc, do you always take the same structured approach to solving problems?

MARC: No, it definitely varies depending upon the context. In some cases, if we're doing a new product introduction for example, it might be a design thinking approach. If there is a lot of data involved, it might be an advanced analytic approach.

And generally, there are five different approaches we typically see in problem solving. There is the hypothesis-led approach, which we're going to go into with a lot more detail in this course, but there are also many others. There is the domain IP-led approach. There's the advanced analytics approach. There's the design thinking approach. And there's engineering approach. And depending upon the context of the problem, one approach may be better than another. And then I think another point is, you don't always just use one approach. Again, depending upon the context, sometimes it's a combination of different approaches, which would get you to the right answer or in some cases to the answer more quickly.

EMILY: I love what you said, Marc, because I actually think what is super interesting is that these five different problem-solving approaches, though the approaches might be a little bit different, their underlying characteristics are all actually very similar. They all share some common characteristics. They all have a very focused problem statement. They're all impact oriented. They always take a stakeholder perspective. They're fact based. And they also focus on synthesis. These characteristics underpin every single one of these different problem-solving approaches.
