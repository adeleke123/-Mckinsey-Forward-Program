## Engineering approach to problem solving

An approach to problem solving to de-risk assumptions by building an MVP and testing it in the market

Video transcript
BELKIS: The engineering problem-solving approach iteratively deploys experimentation to de-risk assumptions by building what we call a Minimal Viable Product, or MVP, and testing it in the market with users. What this allows you to do is iteratively, one release after the other, you are experimenting with what you think is the solution that you want to build.

Every solution you're building, you're de-risking some assumptions that you have around the customer base, or the technology that you need, or the ecosystem that it's supporting. And you're testing it out with the customers by putting it out into the market as the first minimal viable product, first release, then second release, then third release. The core value of the engineering approach is that you're iterating multiple iterations, and you're experimenting, what we call test and learning, with your customers and you're de-risking the key assumptions.

The engineering approach is particularly useful to use for digital product development, for data engineering, for cloud problem that you're trying to solve, where you know that you have a vision, and you want to get to that vision. And instead of waiting till the end to figure out the full solution, you chunk up the solutions into multiple iterations. And you test and learn along the way so that you're building and validating and getting new insights from your users.

It works very well in what we call agile teams. So, as you are thinking about building cross-functional teams that are aligned to a common mission, it's very common for them to use the engineering approach. One example where I've used the engineering approach on the job was where we needed to build a digital experience for a customer, a retail customer. We understood the vision, which is the end vision of how do we do the end-to-end onboarding of the journey. What are all the steps that that customer needs to take?

We decided we were going to start with one focus area â€“ let's allow the customer to go into the branch, request a credit card, and get that credit card within a day without having to manually submit a ton of documents. That was the first MVP, which we call the Minimal Viable Product, the first iteration.

Based on that first iteration, we put it out into the market. We got feedback. Some of the functionalities really didn't stick with the customers. We decided that we should take those out. For example, they didn't need to know their balance upfront, but they definitely wanted to know it as part of their holistic view at the end. We tried in some cases to add some cool features on how they could be identified, but it was actually creating more confusion.

In the subsequent releases, we simplified the experience from the learning. We added additional functionality and continued to build on that journey going forward. That is the concept of let's start with the first iteration, the minimal viable product. Let's add to it, and let's continue to test and learn throughout.

What makes the engineering approach unique and exciting is the flexibility that you get to co-define the solution with your customers and your teams in a very rapid way. What makes it unique is that you set out in the first iteration. You're testing and you're learning new insights that will either validate that solution as something valid you want to continue, or it will give you data that says, you know what, this is not the right direction. Let's go back to the drawing board and think of new solutions so that you're able to continue to build on it. The key insights that you get, the ability to be flexible and involve the customers, and to refine your solution along the way versus waiting till the end is the key superpower that it has.

What is the Engineering approach to problem solving?
Define problem

Outline and understand what to build by defining a vision and value proposition, avoiding excessive detail.

Example vision: build a business bank targeting SMBs in the UK.

Launch first MVP

Design and launch the first minimum viable product with the product team, prioritizing features that solve the key problem.

Aim to launch as soon as possible.

Test and iterate

Following the MVP launch, measure key metrics and make adjustments based on continuous feedback.

Launch subsequent versions at greater scale, building features in an iterative and incremental fashion.

Output

Transfer technology/product knowledge for sustained impact to continue running the product that has been developed.

Typical problems (examples)

Digital product development
Data architecture/engineering
Cloud adoption
