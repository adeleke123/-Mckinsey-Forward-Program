## Your adaptability and resilience journey
Like Michelle, every day we have a chance to practice adaptability: to see challenges as opportunities, to keep going when things are hard, and to respond positively to the changes around us.

Here is the good news: you already know how to do this! You have been learning, growing, and adapting since birth. According to research, adaptability is not a trait; it is a state, which you can develop through practice. In challenging times, being adaptable and resilient reduces our stress, improves our relationships, allows us to make better decisions, and makes our work more rewarding. There is no better time than now to continue building your resilience, like a muscle that gets stronger with time and use.

This course will cover the areas research shows move the needle the most on individual adaptability and resilience. We hope what you learn and practice here will make you be more effective in your current role, future-proof your career, and—hopefully—make living in our fast-paced world more enjoyable.

### Set intentions and develop positive learning habits

Change, uncertainty, and pressure make learning difficult … and yet these challenging times are precisely when it is most important to adapt and grow. The best ways to maximize our learning—and our adaptability—are to be intentional about what we want to learn and to develop positive habits.

+ Strengthen personal adaptability and resilience

### Develop awareness of your mindsets and well-being

Mindsets are more powerful than we once understood, and are critical for adaptability. We can re-wire our brain with new, more resilient mindsets ... but we often don't. As we develop an awareness of our mindsets and well-being, especially during challenging times, we increase our ability to make purposeful, more productive choices that help us thrive in difficult times and adapt to change.

+ Deepen connections

### Strengthen relationships through attention, vulnerability, empathy, and compassion

How we interact with people every day matters to them, to us, and to our workplaces. Quality connections with others dramatically improve the well-being and resilience of both parties and are key markers of successful leaders.

+ Create adaptable teams

### Nurture a psychologically safe environment oriented towards learning

Aligned and psychologically safe teams are the ones that will thrive, and ultimately power innovation and growth during changing times. Consider how many hours you spend working, and how the environment you cultivate can facilitate your and your team's success every day.

+ Reinforce with purpose

### Link your actions to personal and organizational purpose

Intrinsic motivation is one of the most powerful fuels on our life journeys. Having a clear sense of personal meaning helps us cut through the noise of the world and channel our energy towards what matters most, keeping us going when things get challenging.
