## Reflecting on adaptability and resilience

As individuals in an organization, we can benefit from investing in our adaptability: our ability to learn efficiently and apply that learning across a variety of situations. This helps us to grow and thrive in times of change.

We will inevitably experience ups and downs when it comes to adaptability. Let’s look at a representative example. Meet your fictional colleague, Michelle. She was recently promoted to the team manager level. Her new team is responsible for rolling out a major organizational priority, but they are experiencing challenges.

As you glimpse into her work life below, ask yourself:

+ Where is Michelle demonstrating adaptability … or not?
+ How does this resonate with your own experience?
