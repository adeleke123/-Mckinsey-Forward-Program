## Advanced analytics approach to problem solving

The approach used to hypothesize and discover non-obvious insights from big complicated data sets

Video transcript
NARRATOR: So the advanced analytics approach to problem solving is often used when you have big data, very large data sets. The idea here with advanced analytics is, how can you develop non-obvious insights from these large sets of data? The Five I's in advanced analytics approach begin with ideation and thinking about the scope of the problem you're trying to solve. Then we go to intelligence-- how to actually think about the analysis to conduct, and how you're going to ingest that data to actually get to the insights.

In the middle is inception. So you're conducting the analysis, visualizing the data, and actually getting to the recommendations. And then we move to the interventions themselves. How will this be applied? And then independence-- how do you ensure that moving forward, in future cases, that same model approach can continue to operate? The advanced analytics approach is quite useful when you have very large data sets to analyze and problems where you can't come up with a day-one hypothesis, get a spreadsheet, and get an answer.

One example would be if you're looking at customer churn or customer acquisition analytics, looking at millions-- in some cases, billions-- of data points and trying to understand the relationship between those. Advanced analytics is a great approach for those types of problems. Another one might be pricing optimization. Looking across a number of different market segments and product offerings, prices can change monthly, weekly, daily, and sometimes even minute to minute.

Doing that type of analysis is something that requires a different approach to really understand what ideas and interventions you can derive to actually generate value. There are some challenges you need to be aware when applying the advanced analytics approach. Number one-- in terms of the people, you really need expertise, more so than even in the domain IP-led approach.

You need profiles, data scientists, and data engineers who understand how to actually structure the problem, connect all of the data sets, create the actual data architecture that enable the sophisticated analytic algorithms, and models to get the insights. They can then actually interpret what those are and what they mean for the business.

Number two-- this process takes time unlike, again, perhaps the domain IP-led approach, where you probably had a pretty good answer at the end of the first day or the first week of what the answer is, or at least the direction in which it's going to head. With the advanced analytics approach, it takes time to actually conduct the analysis. Actually, it takes a lot of time to actually structure the data before you can do the analysis. It is important to recognize with this process it's going to be a little while before you have even early ideas that you can test.

So you want to think about managing the stakeholders in the process appropriately, being cognizant of the time that it takes, and not over committing. Hey, on day one we're going to have an answer, because you're not. It is going to take, in many cases, days, weeks, and sometimes months to get to a real answer.

What is the Advanced analytics approach to problem solving?
Ideation

Bring together technical and industry expertise to identify opportunities for analytics-driven transformations.

Intelligence

Estimate the value at stake in the opportunity; define and validate the proposed analytical approach while ingesting and engineering the data.

Inception

Translate the data into insights by engineering features, developing and evaluating analytical models, visualizing the insights, and developing the set of interventions needed to improve the business.

Interventions

Track and deliver the changes identified at the end of Inception to improve the business.

Independence

Transfer analytics skills and technology to sustain the impact and deliver future use cases.

Typical problems (examples)

## Acquisition/churn analysis

+ R&D optimization
+ Pricing optimization
