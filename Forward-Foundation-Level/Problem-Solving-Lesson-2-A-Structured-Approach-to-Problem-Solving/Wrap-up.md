## Let’s recap

In this section, you were introduced to five approaches to problem solving and took a closer look at the hypothesis-led approach. You’ve also explored some of the key benefits of taking a structured approach to problem solving. Put simply, a structured approach can help you get to better answers more efficiently, even in the face of uncertainty.

MARC: So let's recap what we've covered in this section. So, we started with understanding when we say problem solving, what do we mean by that. And we talked about some different approaches to problem solving, particularly the hypothesis-led approach. We talked about different ways to apply these tools and techniques day to day. And what are the different time horizons, be it in the moment, over one- or two-weeks, or over a longer-term project, and how we think the application will vary. We talked about the balance between the art and the science, the creativity versus the structured approach, and understanding how problem solving is very iterative.

As we move forward, we're going to dive a little deeper into the hypothesis-led approach, and we're going to think through: how do we best define the problem up front, how do we structure it, and ultimately, how do we work through the analysis to drive to a recommendation.
