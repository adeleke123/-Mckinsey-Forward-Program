## Domain IP-led approach to problem solving

The accelerated 7-steps approach where we apply well tested, codified expertise and capabilities to a known problem

SPEAKER: So what is the domain IP-led approach to problem-solving? Well, it is focused on an accelerated version of the hypothesis-led approach. It applies to domain expertise you have in order to get an answer more quickly.

So you need to have a very good understanding of what the structure of the key drivers of the problem are. You've actually likely done the workplan already in a different instance, and can leverage that, and actually know what a lot of the sources of insights are. It enables you to take that pre-existing knowledge, not have to recreate it, but really focus on the analysis and getting to the unique insights for the problem you're solving.

What is most interesting to me about the domain IP-led approach for problem-solving is that it takes the overall approach of the hypothesis-led approach for problem-solving and really accelerates it. The beginning of the process in terms of defining the problem and the end of the problem-solving process in terms of the synthesis and developing the recommendations is the same, but it's the middle that's different.

As opposed to the hypotheses-led approach, where you're going through a very structured approach to structure the problem, prioritize the issues, think about the work plan, and conduct the analysis, in the domain IP-led approach, you can then step down. You're really focused on scoping the effort, and then actually applying the IP you know to generate the insights.

The key here is to use it when you have examples. It may be pricing analytics. It may be health care analytics, where you're actually have a true expertise and IP knowledge. So you know what the key drivers are going to be. You know what the prioritization of those is going to be, and actually know what the analysis you want to conduct are.

You can apply that pre-existing knowledge much quicker to get to the actual insights. This approach is commonly used in pricing analytics, health care analytics, and any example that's oftentimes quite repeatable, and when you can have pattern recognition and real expertise to accelerate the problem-solving process.

One of the tips that I find most helpful in the domain IP-led approach is to really understand when to apply it, but also recognize the limits of its application. On that second point, it is really important to think about how the IP expertise has evolved since you've last seen the problem.

When might you naturally need to do a little bit more deep dive into structuring the problem? You need to understand what the limits, and perhaps the biases you're bringing are. You're going to have very strong hypotheses going into what the answer is given your domain expertise, but you have to remain open enough during the divergent stage of the problem-solving to explore possible different solutions.
