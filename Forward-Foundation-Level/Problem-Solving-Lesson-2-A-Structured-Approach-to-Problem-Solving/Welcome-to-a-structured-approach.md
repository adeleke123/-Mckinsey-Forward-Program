## Why a structured approach?

There are many formal approaches to problem solving, but most share the same underlying logic. You’re learn about five structured problem-solving approaches in this section, with a deep dive on a classic hypothesis-led approach: a 7-step approach to structure, hypothesize, and efficiently solve the problem.

A robust, structured approach may sound formal and only appropriate to larger-scale problem-solving efforts. In reality, it can be scaled and applied across the spectrum of problem-solving situations. It’s equally helpful with smaller decisions requiring in-the-moment problem solving (e.g., responding to a dissatisfied customer) and large, multi-million-dollar decisions. By learning and practicing the hypothesis-led approach, you will develop mental discipline and rigor that are applicable in many problem-solving situations.
