## Hypothesis-led approach to problem solving

7-step approach to structure, hypothesize, and efficiently solve the problem
MARC: So, what is the hypothesis-led approach for problem solving? Well, by definition, it's asking you to have a hypothesis. And it's taking a very structured approach, and asks you to, when you define the problem upfront, think about what are the hypotheses you're trying to prove or disprove, and make some assertions about those. And then, if you think about the prioritization and the structuring of the work to do that, it's around how you test those hypotheses to get to a better answer more quickly.

It's also an approach that is widely applicable to a range of problems. It scales quite nicely. And it doesn't assume a tremendous amount of expertise, so a lot of folks can use it.

Let's think about an example of where the hypothesis-led approach may apply. If you're thinking about making a big investment, perhaps even acquiring another company, that's a pretty broad question. You may or may not have tremendous amount of expertise, and you may or may not have access to a ton of data. But it's a question with a very clear answer. You either will invest or you won't invest. You will acquire the company, or you won't acquire the company.

In that sense, take that fundamental question as our starting point-- should you do this? And then think about how you then structure the problem and break it down to its component parts. These are great examples of where that hypothesis-led approach can be really powerful.

What makes me really excited about the hypothesis-led approach is that it provides a great structure to enable me to be a more creative problem solver. There is both the art and the science in terms of problem solving. The science in the hypothesis-led approach is around thinking through in a very structured way how you take a very large, complex, ambiguous, hard-to-define problem, break it down into the component parts, and ultimately get to an actionable recommendation.

The art in the process is really the creative element. And what I love is that creative tension when you're debating how we really define the problem is one version of the issue tree superior to another version. The hypothesis-led approach creates that structure to really enable these creative collaborations. And that is really the power of the approach.

What is the Hypothesis-led approach to problem solving?
Define problem

Think impact: what do we need to know?

Structure problem

Think disaggregation and early hypothesis: what could be the key elements of the problem?

Prioritize issues

Think speed: which issues are most important to the problem?

Develop issue analysis/workplan

Think efficiency: where and how should we spend our time?

Conduct analyses

Think evidence: what are we trying to prove/disprove?

Synthesize
findings

Think “so what”: what implications do our findings have?

Develop recommendations

Think potential solution: what should we do?
