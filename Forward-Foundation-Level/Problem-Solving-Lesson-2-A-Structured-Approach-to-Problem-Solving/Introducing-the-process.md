## Introducing the process

Now that you’ve explored multiple approaches to problem solving and their benefits, we’ll take a deep dive into the hypothesis-led approach. This broadly applicable, flexible approach is extremely useful in solving problems (or parts of problems) that require convergent thinking. Communication and iteration are central to every step of the problem-solving process.
The good news? There's no need to memorize these steps now! In upcoming sections, you'll learn about and practice applying each step in typical problem-solving situations you're likely to encounter on the job.
