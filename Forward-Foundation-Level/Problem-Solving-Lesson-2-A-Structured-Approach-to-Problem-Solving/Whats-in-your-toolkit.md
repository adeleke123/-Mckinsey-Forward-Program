## What’s in your toolkit?

The hypothesis-led approach to problem solving relies on key tools and techniques. You can download a set of these now, and you'll have the opportunity to download them individually as they're introduced in context throughout the course. The following are included in the toolkit:

+ SMART
+ Problem statement worksheet
+ Issue tree
+ Hypothesis tree
+ MECE
+ Prioritization matrix
+ Work plan worksheet
+ Influence model

The hypothesis-led approach is applicable regardless of the size of the problem; it can be adapted to address the need at hand while still facilitating a structured approach. As you apply it on the job, you will likely find yourself iterating on steps—diving into them in more or less depth—when working on parts of the same challenge in different situations. On the next page, you’ll see an example.

Optional listening (or reading): Listen to a podcast (or read the transcript) on mastering the seven-step approach to problem solving.
