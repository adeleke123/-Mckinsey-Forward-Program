## Example: Lite Brite

Lite Brite, a multinational conglomerate, has a diversified portfolio of consumer and commercial products. Founded in 1901, the company built its initial business on high-quality light bulbs, in which it is still a market leader. It continually diversified throughout the 20th century, becoming well known for its variety of consumer products and innovation in medical imaging systems. It has a highly respected global brand, and many consumers perceive Lite Brite’s lighting as the highest quality on the market.

Lite Brite has been unable to maintain its market share in an increasingly commoditizing industry, however. It is losing ground to new competitors emerging from China and other markets with low labor costs. The CEO feels real pressure from the board to turn this around.

“Well, this quarter’s numbers continue the trend … revenues are down. We really need to turn this around.”

“We’re never going to win on price alone …. We can’t compete with commodity products.”

“We have to draw on our strengths in innovation and customization.”

In-the-moment problem solving

When dealing with a problem on the spot, an individual or team will be grappling with issues of problem definition and beginning to consider how to break the problem down to attack it. Here, the Lite Brite CEO and the head of strategy are starting to determine exactly what a turnaround means and what types of solutions might be possible.

“We’ll need to share our initial direction on turnaround strategy with the board next week.”

“We should consider ways to increase revenues and ideas to reduce costs.”

“Acquisitions are off the table. And we have to preserve our brand value.”

Problem solving within a week

With a little longer to work on a problem, an individual or team will likely dive into definition and structuring with more rigor—breaking down the problem into its component parts and prioritizing the issues to be investigated. The Lite Brite head of strategy is working to further refine the problem definition—identifying important criteria for success (preserving the brand value) and constraints (no growth by acquisition). He's also developing the structure he’ll use to attack the issue—he'll need to look at both revenues and costs.

“The global growth data is intriguing. It looks like there might be opportunity to invest in some growing markets.”

“And the benchmarking suggests we have some opportunity to increase our margin.”

“Let’s discuss how to pull this all together into a meaningful recommendation.”

Problem-solving project

High-stakes decision making is likely to warrant a full problem-solving project. Individuals and teams will spend considerable time planning the work, conducting the analyses, and synthesizing their results into a recommendation. In Lite Brite's case, the head of strategy will use the issue tree developed to draw insights from the analysis of the team. He will also iterate on the solution with all key stakeholders, ultimately sharing his recommendation with the board.
