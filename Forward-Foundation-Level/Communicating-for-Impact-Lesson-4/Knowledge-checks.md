## Make the case for an in-house MODA yoga studio

The People team at MODA is lobbying their leadership to build a yoga studio in the company headquarters. They believe their employees need a place to literally stretch their creative muscles. They have researched the topic and organized their arguments in a pyramid structure using MECE principles.

Your next step is to write a key line statement for each group of facts. A key line statement synthesizes a group of facts; that is, it offers a new insight that the facts suggest when taken together. We sometimes refer to the synthesis as the "so what" of a group of facts.
