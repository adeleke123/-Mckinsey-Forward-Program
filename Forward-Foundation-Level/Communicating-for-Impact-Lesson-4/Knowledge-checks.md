## Make the case for an in-house MODA yoga studio

The People team at MODA is lobbying their leadership to build a yoga studio in the company headquarters. They believe their employees need a place to literally stretch their creative muscles. They have researched the topic and organized their arguments in a pyramid structure using MECE principles.
