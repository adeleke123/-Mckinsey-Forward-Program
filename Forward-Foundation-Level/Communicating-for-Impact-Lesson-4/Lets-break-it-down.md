## The difference: data, information, and insight

We spend a lot of time on our projects acquiring, analyzing, and visualizing data. While data analysis is important, the real value comes from the insight we provide. Let’s take a closer look at the differences between data, information, and insight.

`Data are…`
…the raw and unprocessed facts that are usually in the form of numbers and text. Data can be quantitative (measured) or qualitative (observed).

`Information is…`
…prepared data that have been processed, aggregated, and organized into a format that provides more context. Information is often delivered in the form of data visualizations, reports, and dashboards.

`Insights are…`
...highly relevant to the audience and not obvious. An insight should be sharp enough to get the audience’s attention and earn its way into a shared fact base that the conversation will draw from.

Insights are generated by analyzing information and drawing conclusions. Both data and information set the stage for the discovery of insights which move the conversation forward. A strong insight can influence and accelerate decisions, and lead to action.
