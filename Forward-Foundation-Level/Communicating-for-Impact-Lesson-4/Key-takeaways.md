## Key takeaways

In this section, you explored the Insight element of the EPIC framework. Key points include:

Insights are generated by analyzing information and drawing conclusions; they cut deeper than data and information
It’s not enough to have the facts; you need to form them into a coherent message
In a business context, your ability to move an audience to action largely depends on your ability to structure a logical argument
The Pyramid Principle is an approach to developing structured, airtight arguments; pyramid structure begins by grouping like facts and insights, which form the foundation of your pyramid
Great communicators synthesize (provide the “so what” of all the facts) rather than summarize (replay the facts in a shorter way)
