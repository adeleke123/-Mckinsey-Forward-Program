In this section, you explored the Insight element of the EPIC framework. Key points include:

+ Insights are generated by analyzing information and drawing conclusions; they cut deeper than data and information
+ It’s not enough to have the facts; you need to form them into a coherent message
+ In a business context, your ability to move an audience to action largely depends on your ability to structure a logical argument
+ The Pyramid Principle is an approach to developing structured, airtight arguments; pyramid structure begins by grouping like facts and insights, which form the foundation of your pyramid
+ Great communicators synthesize (provide the “so what” of all the facts) rather than summarize (replay the facts in a shorter way)
