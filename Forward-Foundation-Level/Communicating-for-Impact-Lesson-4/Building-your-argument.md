## Creating logical groupings

Most often, you deliver your argument top down, but you build it bottom up. In other words

When you deliver the argument, you lead with your thesis and then share the analyses and facts that support it
When you build the argument, you do the opposite: you start by grouping the facts and then you “boil them up” into a well-supported thesis
A pyramid structure begins by grouping like facts and ideas. These groups form the foundation of your pyramid. When structuring arguments, there should be no gaps or overlaps in the groups of facts or arguments at each level. Another way to describe these groupings is that they should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE).

`Governing thought`

`Supporting data`
