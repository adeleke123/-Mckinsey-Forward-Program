## Which mindsets help build adaptability and resilience?

Mindsets influence how we perceive and respond to the world around us, including how we interact with others. There are a number of mindsets that improve our well-being, sense of fulfillment, and performance. These mindsets make our lives more vibrant. Pause and think about a moment when you operated from a mindset that was not particularly helpful.

+ What were you thinking and feeling? How did you behave?
+ What impact did it have on you? What was the impact on others?

Now review some examples of common limiting mindsets and identify any you might have held in your example. On the flip side of each card, you will find an alternative, more adaptable mindset. Focus on the examples that are most relevant for you.

Flip each card to go from the common limiting mindset to the more adaptable mindset.
