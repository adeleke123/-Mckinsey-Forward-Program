## Link to meaning

Each of our experiences of becoming more adaptable and resilient will look and feel different, in part because our motivations are different.

Imagine what you would like your professional and personal life to look like in the coming years. Take a moment to identify the things you want to be celebrating. Now take a moment to imagine the path to get there. Consider what might be exciting and what might be challenging. Try to visualize in as much detail as you can.

*As you consider the journey ahead*

+ What would it unlock for you (and your family, team, business unit or function, and your organization) if you were more adaptable and resilient?
+ What will keep you motivated when things get hard?
