## Agile sprints

Uno Soda has embodied one of the four principles of Agile (being team oriented) in establishing Team Rocket as a cross functional, empowered team.

Team Rocket will enact the other three principles by structuring their work in sprints. A sprint is a development cycle with a goal that can be completed quickly—usually in one to three weeks.

## Sprints allow Agile teams to:

+ Drive continuous value by delivering completed features in every sprint
+ Focus on end users by getting feedback on the deliverables in each sprint
+ Experiment and learn quickly by using what they learn from users in one sprint to adapt the design and work plans in later sprints

1. Scope

Align on the goal for this sprint and criteria for success. What did you learn from previous sprints that affects your design of the solution? How will you measure progress?

2. Sprint backlog

Create a backlog—a prioritized list of all tasks that need to be completed during the sprint.

3. Backlog refinement

Decide which tasks fit within this sprint. Prioritize them based on their impact in achieving the sprint goal and how easy they are to complete.

4. Allocation

Allocate work based on team capacity.

5. Retrospective

At the end of each sprint, review progress, collect feedback, and apply what you learn to the next sprint.

## Apply sprints to your life

Before you help Team Rocket plan their first sprint, try planning one of your own. Apply Agile concepts to one of your goals or projects at work or at home. It could be an elaborate meal you’re planning, a remodelling project, or the launch of a team-wide training.

+ Set the duration of your sprints. Agile teams usually run sprints that are one to three weeks long, but for a home project, your sprints might be shorter. Your sprints should be the right length to enable you to deliver value with each sprint, get feedback from users, and make quick adjustments based on what you learn.
+ Set the goal for the first sprint and define what success looks like for you. A complex project might require multiple sprints.
+ Create your backlog; jot down all of the tasks.
+ Refine your backlog. What tasks will fit in one sprint that’s no more than three weeks long? What tasks are most impactful?
+ Plan your opportunities to learn. What experiments will you do in the first sprint? What feedback will you seek from end users and stakeholders? If this is a multi-sprint project, how will you make adjustments or iterate in future sprints based on what you learn?
