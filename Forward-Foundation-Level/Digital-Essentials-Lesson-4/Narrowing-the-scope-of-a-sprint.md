## Narrowing the scope of a sprint

Team Rocket will complete several two-week sprints to launch a successful campaign featuring their new online marketplace.

In their first sprint, the team’s goal is to test three prototype advertisements in five large metropolitan areas. By the end of the sprint, they will learn which ad concept most appeals to their target market and assess whether the campaign increases website traffic. They will apply what they learn to the work they do in later sprints.
