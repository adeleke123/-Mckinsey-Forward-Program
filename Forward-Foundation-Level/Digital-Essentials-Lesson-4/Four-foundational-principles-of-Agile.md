## Four foundational principles of Agile

Agile approaches were pioneered by software developers aiming to bring new products to market faster. Since then, Agile has evolved across industries to help teams create solutions faster with user feedback, iteration, collaboration, and better team design. Your organization may refer to this approach as Agile or use a different term. Regardless of what you call it, it has four foundational principles.



1. `Focus on end users`
Connect early with users (internal or external) to gain insights and develop solutions that really fit their needs or solve their problems. You can use design thinking, such as creating user personas and analyzing user journeys.

2. `Be team-oriented`
Work in small teams with experts across relevant functions. The team is responsible for the solution and empowered to make decisions—leaders have removed cumbersome approval processes and other roadblocks.



3. `Drive continuous value`
Focus on the end goal, starting small and working incrementally to create the most valuable elements first. Your team should have concrete ways to measure success.

4. `Experiment and learn quickly`
Work in short test-and-learn cycles to create the right product, service, or process—remaining flexible without consuming lots of resources.
