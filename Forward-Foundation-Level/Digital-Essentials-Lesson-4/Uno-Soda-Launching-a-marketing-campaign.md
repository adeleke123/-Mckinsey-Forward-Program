## Uno Soda: Launching a marketing campaign

At Uno Soda, Team Rocket has used design thinking to learn that younger customers are interested in shopping online for new and unusual soda flavors, but are frustrated by the current website experience. Using Agile methodology, Team Rocket will improve the online shopping experience. This initiative should help the company achieve its goal of increasing revenues by 25% in three years.

Team Rocket begins with one goal: Test three marketing campaigns featuring the online marketplace, geared towards younger customers. The campaign will launch in five urban areas.
