What do we know about unconscious biases?
Unconscious biases are a result of being exposed to more information than we can process at any given point in time. They give us a shortcut to our decision-making process, based on recognized patterns that we've unconsciously established over the course of our lives. But as a result, they may not always serve us well and can lead to false conclusions and unintended consequences.
Putting in place a few checks or questions that you can ask yourself can ensure that you are less likely to fall victim to unconscious biases. This is also another great place where you can engage your team members, colleagues, and peers.
If you're curious about what unconscious biases you might hold, there are many online resources to help test where you may hold a preference or distrust for certain groups. Take a look at the [Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) offered by Harvard
