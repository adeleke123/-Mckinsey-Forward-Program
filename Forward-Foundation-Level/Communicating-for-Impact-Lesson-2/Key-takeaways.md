## Key takeaways

In this section, you explored the Empathy element of the EPIC framework. Key points include:

Empathy is the ability to recognize emotions in others and to understand other people’s perspectives on a situation
An “over there” mindset allows you to focus on the other person and the broader relationship you want to build with your audience
Building a connection with your audience, especially during stressful times, can lead to measurable positive outcomes that benefit you, the audience, and your organization
Although you may not correctly anticipate how someone might be feeling and what they’re thinking, the simple act of thinking through someone’s possible emotions, concerns, or overall perspective can lead you to ask the right question or navigate that tricky conversation when you meet for the first time
Getting to know people or the audience is a fascinating part of the journey.
