## Disaster 2.0
At the end of the day, Aaliyah gets a meeting request from Kobi Badu, MODA’s CEO. Kobi wants to have a quick check-in at 6pm.

In his office, he looks Aaliyah in the eye and says, “It’s late. Let me just cut to the chase, Aaliyah. I’m already hearing some talk in the office about mixed feelings around this transformation from senior leaders. They clearly don’t understand the motivation behind this effort. This is based on real data, not personal preferences. As you know, the last attempt at a transformation at MODA was a bit of a disaster. People are already calling this Disaster 2.0. It’s not a nickname I love! But they clearly have their own agendas. There’s a lot of politics at play here. Are you prepared to respond to this?”
