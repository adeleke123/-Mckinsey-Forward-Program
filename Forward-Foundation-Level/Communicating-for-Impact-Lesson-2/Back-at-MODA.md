NARRATOR: Today, Aaliyah has invited Noah to a meeting to introduce herself as chief transformation officer. Aaliyah wants to discuss how she, Noah, and the digital department are going to collaborate to ensure a successful transformation.

NOAH: What's next on the agenda? My meeting with Aaliyah. What's this about again? Right, the transformation. Uh, the last time we had a transformation, my team wasn't happy. I bet she already has some hard deadlines in mind. I am so hungry. Why on earth do people schedule meetings at lunchtime?

AALIYAH: I have a meeting with Noah soon. I can't wait to have some extra brainpower on this. Oh, everything's starting to catch up with me these days-- my personal training, the Women's Mentorship Initiative, my local youth group, and now this-- the transformation. Aaliyah, stop and breathe. Remember what your meditation app tells you to do. Breathe in the positive energy. Breathe out the negative energy. I'm confident my team can make this work.

NOAH: Hi, Aaliyah. How are you?

AALIYAH: Oh, hey. Oops. Let me get these crumbs off my desk. I'm so sorry. I promise I don't usually have meetings over lunch.

NOAH: No worries.

AALIYAH: It's been one of those days, Noah. But thank you for being flexible. I realized I've been here five years, and I've never had the chance to work with you.

NOAH: I know, kind of hard to believe. I bet we'll make a grand team.

AALIYAH: Absolutely. So I wanted to take some time before our full team kickoff to get to know each other a little better. We'll be working closely together, so I really want us to have a clear sense of our roles in the transformation. Anything else that you think would be helpful for us to talk about today?

NOAH: Well, it would be helpful if you'd just share your plan and deadlines, so my team can keep up with you. Then, I know whether we can deliver. Oh, get a grip, Noah. You can't say that. Aaliyah looks like she's in a tight spot right now with everything that's been going on.

NARRATOR: Starting off on the right track means putting yourself in the other person's shoes. What are they thinking and feeling? And why? What is at stake for them? Taking the time before and during your conversation to recognize where someone is coming from can help you meet them where they stand.

NOAH: To be honest Aaliyah, it would be great to start off by learning more about you. How are you feeling in the new role? I bet you got a lot on your plate right now.

AALIYAH: I know. I didn't expect the transformation to kick off this early, so I'm trying to wrap up a bunch of different things on my to-do list.

NOAH: I feel you. But hey, you're not alone. You have a great team here to support you. Do you know what? Let's go introduce you to the rest of the team.
