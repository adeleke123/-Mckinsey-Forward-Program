What is there to gain from being an empathetic communicator? Sasha Zolley and Beth Lakin share the positive impact of empathetic communications on yourself, your team, and your organization.

SASHA ZOLLEY: We like individuals who like us, and the way that we communicate whether or not we like each other is by answering our bids for attention to be noticed, to be seen in our own individual and unique ways.

BETH LAKIN: When we talk about empathy, we mean seeing things from another person's perspective. It doesn't mean we have to agree with that perspective or share it, but it just means that we can think through how that person might see the world and try and understand it.

SASHA ZOLLEY: Getting good at empathy can really unlock the potential of your communications. If you think about it, personalized messages always hit home harder. If you see or hear something that resonates with you, you are more likely to be spurred to action. Empathy is equally important in business context.

It reduces turnover and burnout, something that we should all be mindful of given the constantly changing contexts in which we operate in. It also is something that improves job satisfaction. So team members with more empathetic leaders or leaders within an organization are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. Recently, a study found that the skill of empathy is actually one of the top predictors of senior executive effectiveness. At their job, in terms of delivering business results, in terms of leading teams, and driving them towards their potential.

BETH LAKIN: But empathy is not easy, and it's particularly difficult when we're stressed or when we're in a very time-constrained environment, which, let's be frank, often, we all are.

SASHA ZOLLEY: Unfortunately, empathy is something that remains low in business, with around 40% of leaders testing as proficient in empathy. Empathy, like emotional intelligence, is a skill that can be acquired, learned, and practiced. You can get better at trying to tune into what others are feeling or what others are experiencing, and if you are not somebody who readily picks up on emotional cues or the feelings of others, that's absolutely OK.

BETH LAKIN: So one situation I've been in where I haven't applied empathy successfully was in a training I once ran for a group of managers. The training was on difficult conversations and conflict, but one piece of context I wasn't aware of was that the managers in question had recently been told they'd have to carry out headcount reduction in their teams. The training had been designed to be interactive and lighthearted and fun, but given the context to the managers, this appeared to be not directly relevant to the situation they were in, and worse, it actually appeared flippant.

Halfway through the training, I stopped, and I sensed that things weren't being received the way I intended and I asked the group how they were feeling, and this story came out. And once I understood the context, I was able to adjust the training to fit their specific context, and we talked through some of the challenges and concerns they had, and we had a really productive discussion. The lesson from this for me was, not only is empathy important to apply when you're planning your discussion, but even with the best planning in the world, you also need to show empathy during the discussion. And don't be afraid to stop, ask how people are feeling, and then revise your approach as needed.

SASHA ZOLLEY: It's important to remember that you should not stop at empathy. Empathy is just a way for you to understand the context of the other individual, then you should follow it up with an action, an action that hopefully is compassionate and is informed by kindness and good intention towards the other individual. So just think of empathy as one of the first steps and it's followed by an action that corresponds to the feeling and the experiences that you picked up on.
