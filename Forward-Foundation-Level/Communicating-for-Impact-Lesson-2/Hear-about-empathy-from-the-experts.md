KWEILIN ELLINGRUD: Empathy is so important in what we do, because trust is the foundation of all of our professional relationships. When people feel that you can put yourself in their shoes and understand what they might be going through, whether that's emotionally, could be in their personal lives, they're much more likely to listen to your recommendation because they feel that you care about them.

SHAIL THAKER: You're also in a situation, where what you're going to be communicating isn't 90% of their life and that is not going to be the single most important thing that they have been waiting for all day. Sometimes it is, but more often than not, it isn't.

KWEILIN ELLINGRUD: I have a number of examples where empathy played a really critical role. I think on the positive side, when somebody gets a promotion or is very excited about a new role, jumping in with them and helping them think through what are the challenges ahead, how do they make the most of that opportunity, I think it's a critical moment of truth to be both empathetic and be there for those that you're close with. I think on the other side, though, I think empathy is even more important when things aren't going well.

That's the time when colleagues, friends, don't have everybody calling on them, and to be empathetic and truly there for them at that moment is so critical. So one of my clients lost his job, and when I reached out and helped him think through what might he want to do next, what were some contacts that he could reach out to, I think that was the moment when empathy really made a difference in our relationship.

SARA PRINCE: Often, when you think about empathy and communication, you quickly go to emotion or personal or something that makes it seem like it shouldn't be necessarily in a professional setting. That it's too touchy feely and emotional, but if you dig into it, frequently, the conversations we're having in a professional setting really do get those most underlayers of how people define themselves, how they identify themselves, the work that they're doing, the behaviors that they have every single day, and ultimately, in a lot of communication, you're trying to get people to change those things or use those elements to embrace the direction you want to take them on.

And so it becomes really critical to understand those elements and those starting places even in a professional setting.
