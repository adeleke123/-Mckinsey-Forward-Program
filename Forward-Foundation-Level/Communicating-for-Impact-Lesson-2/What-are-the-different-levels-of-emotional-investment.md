## The spectrum of Empathy

Empathy is the ability to recognize emotions in others and to understand other people’s perspectives on a situation. However, there are different levels of empathy: cognitive, emotional, and compassionate.

Your emotional investment increases as you move from cognitive empathy to compassionate empathy. And clearly this changes based on the context and variables involved. It’s interesting (sometimes fascinating) how in one scenario it may be a challenge to have cognitive empathy but easy to have compassionate empathy, while in another scenario, cognitive empathy may come more easily than compassionate empathy.

Pause to ask yourself: where do I fall on the spectrum in any given situation?
