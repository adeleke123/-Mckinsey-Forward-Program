## Adopting an inclusive mindset

An important part of being an empathetic communicator is having an inclusive mindset. Monne Williams and Sasha Zolley share what an inclusive mindset looks like and where you can go wrong when it comes to empathy.

SASHA ZOLLEY: People are more likely to engage when they feel like they are included in the conversation, when they feel that their unique perspective or individual experiences matter and are relevant to the topic at hand, to the situation that's being discussed. And oftentimes, when people do not feel that they are included in the conversation, they become disengaged. And sometimes that happens overtly. And sometimes it happens subconsciously.

MONNE WILLIAMS: When I think about being an inclusive communicator, I think about a few things. I think about the message that I intend to communicate. I think about the audience that I want to try to reach. And I also think about what's the best way to combine those two things.

As an inclusive communicator, you'll sometimes be tempted to put yourself in someone's shoes as the saying goes. Sometimes that means thinking about how the other person would react, and feel, and you're trying to get very specific about this other person's emotions and motivations. It's often hard to do that, because you may not know enough about this individual person. You may be from a very different background when you think about things like identity-- so gender, where someone's from, when you're thinking about global organizations, in particular.

But I think when you think about putting yourself in someone else's shoes, you can think about it across a few other dimensions that we can all practice regularly. One is position. So if you're a manager now and you were an individual contributor before, trying to remember what that experience was like for you and what are the types of questions or concerns you often had when you talk to someone who was more senior than you in the organization.

Often when you want to communicate something, you're the holder of the information or the more powerful one in this particular context. And so it's easy to forget that you may be in the end group or the end crowd that has all the information, has the resources. And one of your aims is to try to bring other people up to speed or to get them involved or to influence them in some sort of way. So one of the things I like to think about a lot is how would someone who's on the other side of this, who may have less information than me, has been less involved in the process overall, and maybe not as invested in the outcome as I am, because I've been working on this for a while, how might they respond to the message?

SASHA ZOLLEY: I think many of us have had an experience when you walk into a conversation and you really feel out of place. Either it's a technical conversation among colleagues and you're not privy to the jargon or the context, or sometimes it's a group of old friends that haven't seen each other in a while and you feel a bit like an outsider.

Sometimes you can make others feel excluded and not belonging just by the type of conversation you initiate. And as a leader being mindful of how to ensure that every voice is in the conversation, that every person feels like it's comfortable to jump in and join and offer his or her own perspective, that's something that you need to care for. And that's what will create a feeling of belonging and inclusion in an environment.
