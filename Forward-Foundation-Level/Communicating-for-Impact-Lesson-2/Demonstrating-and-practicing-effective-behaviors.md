## How to practice active listening

Active listening is a critical part of having an “over there” mindset. There are several ways to demonstrate and practice active listening in your interactions.

Active listening behaviors
Supporting and encouraging

Encouraging – “Yes, I see,” “Of course,” expressions (e.g., smiling), open body stance
Validating – “If I were in your situation, I’d feel the same way,” nodding/shaking head
Imagining – “I can imagine it’s frustrating for you”
Reflecting and repeating

Summarizing – “So would it be right to say there are three main issues …,” “It sounds like you’re saying”
Describing – “You seem upset by that,” “It sounds like you felt angry with him”
Digging deeper

Clarifying – “Why do you think that happened?” “Which of those issues came first?”
Open – “How are you feeling about the project?” “What’s going on for you this week?”
Offering help

Personal – “Is there anything I can do to help?”
Hypothetical – “What would you like to happen in an ideal world?” “How can we make that a reality?”
