## Moving from “over here” to “over there”
For any interaction, you should start with an open and curious mindset, both in preparation for a conversation and throughout each point of a conversation. An easy way to nudge yourself before a conversation is to think: Am I currently “over here” or “over there”?

“Over here” mindset
An “over here” mindset is focused on yourself and your own agenda. When someone is in an “over here” mindset, they tend to be transaction-oriented, insular, and often hierarchical. They may be judgmental, distracted, and uninterested in the other person.

“Over there” mindset
An “over there” mindset is focused on the other person and the broader relationship. Your interaction is one of a counselor. It is inclusive and collaborative with the other person. Remember— a great communicator is attentive and curious and listens.
