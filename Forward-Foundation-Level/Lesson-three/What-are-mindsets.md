## What are mindsets?

Mindsets are the belief filters between you and reality. They influence what you perceive, how you feel, and how you behave. As you just saw, they are extremely powerful. In fact, they are arguably the most important thing when it comes to adaptability and resilience.

Mindsets are attitudes and beliefs that your brain uses as filters. Think of them as a mental lens that impacts how you see yourself and the world around you. You perceive something—a conversation or an event—and your mindset influences your thoughts and feelings and helps you interpret them and define your choices.

More than impacting how you see, think, and feel about things, your mindsets ultimately drive your behavior. For example, let's say your colleague asks you to sketch a visual design for a brochure. If your first thought is, “I'm just not good at that sort of thing,” you may be operating from a fixed mindset—and the task at hand might make you feel anxious or even annoyed. It could lead you to procrastinating and avoiding the job.

Can you think about a time you held a fixed mindset recently? What impact did this have on you? The next time you find yourself in a similar situation and mindset, you can choose a different approach. If you try out a growth mindset, such as, “I enjoy new opportunities to grow my skills,” you're more likely to be excited and curious about this new challenge. In any given moment, the mindset you operate from can either be a deliberate choice or one of the many default mindsets each of us carries.

But where did these default mindsets come from? Typically, they are shaped by past experiences and the reactions you've had in similar situations. As a result, you carry helpful mindsets and some not so helpful ones.

Perhaps a manager in the past consistently praised you for being an outside the box thinker, so you're wired to prefer a mindset of experimentation and risk taking in similar environments. Or maybe you worked at an organization where you were frequently made to feel inadequate when you voiced suggestions during team meetings. In turn, this instilled a mindset that you must be an expert to speak up, fearing that otherwise you may look bad at your job.

Take a moment to think which mindsets that you might be carrying that are not actually serving you well.

Just because you're carrying all these default mindsets with you, it doesn't mean you always have to operate from them. In fact, you can actually choose the mindset that is most appropriate at the time, depending on what the situation is and what you want to accomplish. Research shows it's possible if you're aware of what your current mindset is and know which one might serve you better instead.

How important is this? Extremely. Mindsets can empower you or hold you back. Study after study confirms that everything from school achievement and job performance to life satisfaction, stress management, and even your physical health is driven, at least in part, by your mindsets. Now that you're aware of the abundance of mindsets around you, why not choose the ones that serve you best?
