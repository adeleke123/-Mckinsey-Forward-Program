### Consider your own mindsets
It is true that mindsets associated with adaptability and resilience bring about many benefits, but we do not label mindsets as simply “good” or “bad.” Instead, we aim to adopt the mindset best suited to each situation. For example, circumstances might require us to be experts or to react based mostly on our knowledge and experience. The key to adaptability is being aware of our mindsets so we can make more deliberate choices.

Let’s build this awareness.
