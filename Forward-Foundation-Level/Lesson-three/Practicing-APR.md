## Practicing APR

The beauty of APR is that it can be utilized at any time to shift your mindset in subtle or bold ways. Let’s take two minutes to practice it right now.

+ `Awareness`: Think of something you have been finding challenging. What does it make you think and feel? What are your mindsets?
+ `Pause`: Take a pause in this very moment to center yourself. Maybe take a few deep breaths or plant your feet on the floor.
+ `Reframe`: What opportunities would there be if you were to shift your mindset?
Continue to think about ways you can flexibly incorporate APR in your daily practices. In particular, think about how you can practice integrating questions that will help you to reframe specific mindsets.
