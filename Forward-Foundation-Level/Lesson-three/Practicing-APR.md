## Practicing APR

The beauty of APR is that it can be utilized at any time to shift your mindset in subtle or bold ways. Let’s take two minutes to practice it right now.

+ `Awareness`: Think of something you have been finding challenging. What does it make you think and feel? What are your mindsets?
+ `Pause`: Take a pause in this very moment to center yourself. Maybe take a few deep breaths or plant your feet on the floor.
+ `Reframe`: What opportunities would there be if you were to shift your mindset?
Continue to think about ways you can flexibly incorporate APR in your daily practices. In particular, think about how you can practice integrating questions that will help you to reframe specific mindsets.

### Take it to your team
Whether you are a manager or a peer, you can use your newfound knowledge of mindsets to nudge others in the right direction. Here are four actions you can take.

### Role model
When people see an adaptable mindset, they are drawn to imitate it. Talk openly about your mindsets, both the helpful and unhelpful ones, and what you do to reframe your mindset. Be as specific as possible.

### Help them use APR
Share the APR approach and help others use it. If tensions are high at a meeting, for example, and some people have adopted limiting mindsets, draw awareness to it and help team members pause.

### Prime them
Using phrases is a great way to prime others. For example, to get others into an abundance mindset you might ask, “What is the win-win here?” For a growth mindset you could try, “What can we learn from this?”

### Reinforce mindsets
Point out to others when they are demonstrating helpful mindsets and encourage them further. For example, if a colleague was operating from a creative place during a challenge, point out that it would have been easy to slip into a reactive mode and encourage everyone to keep up the creative mindset.
