The first critical step
All problem-solving efforts—whether they require in-the-moment solutions or months of analysis—begin with the same critical step: defining the problem. This section focuses on that first step of the hypothesis-led problem-solving approach.

Why is this step so important? Put simply, it means you’re solving for the right problem.

When setting out to solve a problem, the temptations are many:

Relying on instincts and experience to make quick judgments under pressure
“Biting off more than you can chew” and attempting to solve for a much larger problem than required, or for which resources are inadequate
Forgetting the needs and priorities of the stakeholders for whom you are solving the problem
As you'll see in this section, the very best problem solvers benefit from slowing down and questioning their instincts. It's critical to take a rigorous and creative approach in rapid-turn situations and on longer-term projects.
