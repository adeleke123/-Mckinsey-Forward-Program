## Can you identify the bias?

When problem solving, we are all prone to biases that color our perceptions. Biases aren’t always bad. They can be useful as a means of incorporating knowledge and experience into problem solving. But some types of biases color our thinking in ways that are not useful. In all parts of the problem-solving process, keep these types of biases—and techniques to control their impact—in mind. You will be introduced to each of these biases throughout this course, as they apply to the hypothesis-led approach.

“Because growth is likely to continue at the recent historical rate of 20%, we should determine our entry strategy for the U.S. market.”

Confirmation biases
Confirmation bias is the tendency to view new evidence as confirming an existing hypothesis. People with this bias may need twice as much evidence to reject an expected hypothesis than to accept an expected one. In fact, most people stop looking once they find what seems like sufficient confirming evidence.

Two techniques discussed in this course can help you combat confirmation biases:

Key assumption check: Spot faulty assumptions you’ve inherited, or that are accepted across the industry, by explicitly listing and testing each assumption.
Analysis of competing hypotheses: Reduce bias and get to the very best answer by considering multiple hypotheses and aligning evidence against them.
“It's highly unlikely that our market entry strategy will fail to deliver the growth we're expecting.”

Confidence biases
Confidence bias includes the tendency to disregard warning signs. Company strategies fail about half the time, yet 80 to 90 percent of CEOs expect their strategies to succeed.

A pre-mortem analysis can help ward off confidence bias. Imagine yourself in the future and that your strategy has failed. Then figure out why it failed and what you could have done to prevent it.
“We should embrace the market entry approach we've used to enter major markets in the past.”

Stability biases
Stability bias is the tendency to hang onto an inherited mindset. Once people with this bias have formed a hypothesis, they produce about a third as many creative ideas—their experience leads to self-censorship of new thinking.

We can use a range of creative techniques to combat stability biases:

Constraint release: List the main constraints and relax them one by one to see if any interesting ideas emerge. If possible, design ways to circumvent the constraint.
Point-of-view analysis: State the problem or proposed idea then write the names of four to six people who might have different views. Restate the problem from these points of view and design a different solution.
