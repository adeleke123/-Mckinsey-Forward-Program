## Let’s take a closer look

A primary tool for defining a problem is the Problem Statement Worksheet. This tool will give you and any collaborators a deeper understanding of the problem by helping you reflect on and discuss the context, stakeholders, and scope. This awareness often generates fruitful and even surprising insights. Post a copy of the Problem Statement Worksheet in your office and refer to it frequently to stay focused on the right problem—even when you don't have a lot of time.

Problem question (the basic question to be resolved)
In the form of a question, concisely define what must be resolved. This will help you focus your efforts and come up with actionable findings. Your basic question should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound.


Context
Think about the environment around the problem you’re facing. Will internal or external situations affect how you solve the problem? What potential complications should you consider? This field of inquiry may encompass historical or current industry trends, the availability of finances, or skill gaps on your team.


Stakeholders


Constraints within solution space
While scope defines the space of your solution, constraints include what can or cannot happen within that space.


Scope of solution space
What will and will not be considered in your solution? The scope should be broad enough so that you consider all relevant solutions yet narrow enough to maintain focus and keep your analysis manageable.
Criteria for success
What must happen for the solution to be successful? What could happen to cause the solution to fail? Consider timing of impact, visibility of improvement, mindset shifts, and what success looks like for key stakeholders. Criteria should be SMART so you can judge whether the final solution satisfies them.

Key sources of insight
These are where you will turn for information. What resources can you tap to simplify your team’s effort and avoid repeating work that is already being done?
