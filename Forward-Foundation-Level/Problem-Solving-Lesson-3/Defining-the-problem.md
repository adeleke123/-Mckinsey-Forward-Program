## Defining the problem

We only have 45 minutes to figure this out!
Arun, a marketing VP at DentMerc, an industrial company in Mumbai specializing in dental products, needs to quickly review a proposal his team put together. DentMerc’s CEO, Apoorva, has asked for a proposal on the market research required to determine whether to enter the well-established Southeast Asian toothbrush market with a new product—a toothbrush with an easily replaceable brush head, the Click*Brush. The overall budget for the project is 150 lakh rupees (15 million INR), which market research must share with teams from other areas, with a one-month timeline.

The CEO’s request has a tight turnaround—she needs to gather input immediately as new production capacity just became available. She would like to put it to use ASAP and, to that end, would like to determine which product it will be dedicated to first.

On top of the tight turnaround, when the CEO’s request came in, Arun was visiting a production site. He’s just returned and is only now able to turn his attention to the proposal, which the team will present to the CEO in just 45 minutes. Arun must problem-solve in the moment.
