## A mental checklist
It might feel overwhelming to think about all aspects of the Problem Statement Worksheet, especially when you have little time. But with some practice, you can learn to use it flexibly, for example, as a mental checklist to confirm that youâ€™ve covered all major blind spots or to systematically guide and structure longer-term problem-solving efforts.

MARC: So, what does using the problem statement worksheet in the moment actually look like? Well, in the moment you're unlikely to actually whip out a sheet of paper, go through all the different components, and fill it out. But what you can do is think about the different components of that problem statement worksheet, and what questions you can ask.

Let me give you a real example from this morning. I woke up this morning, and there was a water main break outside of my apartment on the Upper West Side. And there was a problem. The street was flooded. And so I needed to think through, in the moment, how was I going to deal with that problem and what was the problem that I needed to solve.

Obviously, there's a water main break. But importantly, who are all the stakeholders that are going to be impacted? How am I going to get to the office to do this video shoot? How are my children going to get to school this morning? How are the deliveries that were supposed to come that afternoon going to be received or impacted by this water main break?

So, going through that structured approach enabled me to think through very rapidly, in that moment, how best to address this problem. When you're filling out the problem statement worksheet in the moment, there are a couple of mistakes that we commonly see. One is when thinking about the stakeholders. And the key here is to really ensure you've thought about all the relevant stakeholders that need to be involved in order to actually have your recommendation be actionable.

Another is the scope of the solution set. Have you been very clear, and is everybody aligned on what is in scope versus what is out of scope. The third is thinking through the constraints. Here it's being really honest in terms of what are the constraints one needs to solve for, and that has implications then for thinking through the time and resources you have available and how best to prioritize your work moving forward.

EMILY: The problem statement worksheet is one of the most effective tools, I think, that we can actually use as problem solvers. And the way that I always thought about it when I first started in my career is I thought, oh my gosh, I have to have an answer for every single box on this robust worksheet. And the truth of the matter is, I think that sometimes the most powerful way to use the tool is to use it in a dynamic, ad-hoc way.

What are the ways that we can ask the right questions to tease out the answer, even if we don't actually have the time to robustly fill it out. A problem statement worksheet should not be something that you start on day one and never refresh. It should be something that you actually, as you learn more about the problem and understand more stakeholders, you continue to iterate so that it becomes something that's truly the latest and greatest in thinking.
