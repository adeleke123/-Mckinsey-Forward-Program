## The tools to help define the problem

In this section, you’ve explored how the define the problem step of the hypothesis-led, seven-step approach to problem solving is critical for success—it helps you solve the right problem. You have also explored some practical, easy-to-use techniques to remove bias from your process.

MARC: So, let's recap the key points in the section. When we're thinking about defining the problem there are a number of different tools and frameworks we've covered. Have we been SMART in terms of how we've defined the problem? Is it specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time bound?

In terms of the problem statement worksheet are we all aligned on what the problem is we're trying to solve? And have we been thoughtful around some of the dimensions in terms of the context, the scope of the solution space, and how we're going to measure success? With debiasing, have we thought about some of the biases that may come into our problem-solving approach and how we are going to debias or ensure those biases don't negatively impact our solution?

And as we go forward the last thing that I would say around problem definition is that it's a very iterative process. And so it is both important in the moment to take the time to define the problem as well as you can; it is equally important in longer-term projects, over the coming weeks and months, to go back to the definition of the problem and test it and ask yourself, are there assumptions we made around the stakeholders, the scope of the solution set, and the key sources of insight that we need to refine to enable us to come to a better solution.
