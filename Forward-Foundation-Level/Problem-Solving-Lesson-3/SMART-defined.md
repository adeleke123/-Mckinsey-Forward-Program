A snapshot of SMART
Pushing for a SMART problem question can have a profound impact on your problem solving, clarifying the challenge and defining what it really means to address it.

SMART problem definition
Specific

Is the question specific enough? Your problem question needs to be detailed enough so that those who are closest to the problem can understand exactly what needs to be solved.

Measurable

A measurable result will be instrumental in helping you determine that the problem is truly solved. This should be a quantifiable number.

Actionable

The problem question should point to the action required to solve the problem. It usually includes words like "how" or "actions that need to be taken."

Relevant

Your problem question should be relevant to everyone involved in the situationâ€”the executive, your team, and any other stakeholders. It's important to align everyone so you all have the same goals.

Time-bound

Problem questions should always be time-bound to ensure that everyone comes up with solutions that are practical in the timeframe you have defined.
