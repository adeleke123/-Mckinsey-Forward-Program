## Getting crystal clear on your problem

Getting the problem question right is just one aspect of robust problem definition. You can use another tool—a Problem Statement Worksheet—to help ensure you're thinking through the most important elements of a problem.

MARC: So the problem statement worksheet is an approach that we use to make sure that the definition of the problem is the best it can be. It starts with asking what is the problem we're trying to solve? And there, we apply the SMART framework to ensure that that definition is as clear and concise as possible, and everybody's aligned on that definition.

It then has a number of other components it asks us to consider: What is the context of the problem? What is the scope of the solution set? What are the constraints that we need to solve for? Who are all the stakeholders we need to think through? And ultimately, how are we going to measure success? The benefit of using the problem statement worksheet is that it's a great way to drive alignment and ensure everyone is aligned on what the problem we're trying to solve is, and that we've really nailed the definition of the problem.

So why do we use these components in the problem statement worksheet? Well, it enables us to do a number of different things. It enables us to think about how can we best align everyone on this problem, both the people directly involved in this problem-solving process and the wider set of stakeholders. It also enables us to be creative and think about what are all the options we should be considering and what is in the scope, and ensure that all the different sources of insight are fully thought through from the beginning of the process.

And it also has an element of making sure we're practical. And so, as we think about what does success look like, as we think about the constraints that we're facing, it enables us to be more precise when we get to the structuring and prioritization steps of the hypothesis-led approach and to get there more efficiently. So the problem statement worksheet enables you to both broaden the solution set by thinking about whether you thought about the full scope and all the different stakeholders that need to be involved; at the same time it ensures that it's practical and you've thought about the different constraints you need to solve for in order to deliver the impact and meet the criteria for success.
