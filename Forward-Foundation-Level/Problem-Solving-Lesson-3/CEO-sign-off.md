## Asking the right questions

Asking powerful questions is one of the most effective tools you can deploy in problem solving. Questions that help drive towards a more rigorous problem definition are especially helpful for in-the-moment problem-solving situations.

View the video to see how Arunâ€™s powerful questions more clearly define the problem his team is trying to solve, and in the process, reduce the budget and scope significantly.


## Video transcript

Arun: Main question is, what factors contribute to the [INAUDIBLE] decision?

Manish: I was going with color, size, but it's hard to know. There's so much to consider.

Amrita: And we don't have a lot of time to do research.

Arun: In this case, let's see if we can leverage our experience.

Amrita: OK, yes of course, perhaps similar projects could tell us something.

Manish: OK. What about last year, the floss project, right? Same thing, we were trying to decide whether to enter the market with a new product.

Amrita: Right, and what was the critical data on that project? I remember, hinging the decision on what are customers willing to pay for it?

Manish: Customers willing to pay for it?

Arun: Pay for it. So the price point, right? But is it applicable here?

Amrita: I mean, yeah, the competitive landscape for both the products is similar.

Manish: Why didn't we think of this before?

Arun: We thought of it now. OK.

Amrita: And I'm thinking the price points are similar and target market.

Arun: That is great comparison across multiple dimensions. Nice work.

Manish: Price, not color or size?

Arun: For now, yes. We'll just focus on the important questions.

Manish: What they are willing to pay?

Arun: What are they willing to pay for this product, that will be the focus of our research.

Amrita: I'm almost thinking now of the brightening strip project.

Arun: The brightening strip project. Yes, so similar. And if I recall correctly, a big piece of the critical data was? Anyone?

Amrita: Performance specifications.

Arun: Performance specifications. It was before you joined the company. Brightening strips, that's a good example. Anyway, what we found out was that the decision came down to what performance specifications had to be equal to or better than the competitor's products.

Manish: So do they make your teeth whiter or at least as white?

Arun: Yeah, that was one of the most important ones in fact. Let's quickly revise our research budget, assuming that we're just focusing on these important questions.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Wow, see now, we've come down from 50 lakh rupees proposed budget, now to, yes, 15lakh rupees

Amrita: That's awesome.

Arun: Yeah, by tightly focusing our research on the questions which have been helpful on similar projects in the past. What do you think? Are we ready to present?

Manish: Yes.

Amrita: Let's go.

Arun: Here we come approval. Let's go.

Manish: Don't worry color and packaging, we'll get you next time.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Amrita: That went great.

Arun: Yeah.

Amrita: I think approval was really impressed by the clarity and focus of the proposal.

Manish: And the price tag.

Arun: Yeah, great job, guys. I'm really excited to find out what our research tells us.
