## Debiasing techniques

### What biases do you bring to the table?

Especially in the throes of time pressure, the temptation to "go with your gut" can run high. Debiasing techniques can help you break this habit and think explicitly about the biases you’re bringing to the table.

MARC: So, what is debiasing and why is it so important when defining a problem? Debiasing is taking a very structured approach to think about what are some of the biases that may come into the way we define a problem up front and think about what can we do as problem-solving leaders to try to take that bias out of the situation.

EMILY: Everyone has biases. It's interesting, but we often think that others have biases but we ourselves don't. And it's interesting that when you do problem solving in the moment, your biases are not always at the forefront of your thinking. Put differently, biases are actually oftentimes good, because they're heuristics, they're human heuristics, they're shortcuts, so that we know when a lion is running towards us we don't have to actively problem solve. We understand that, hey, the shortcut is we got to run. So, biases are intrinsically there to protect us.

However, we actually need to be aware of them as business leaders to really make sure that we're not reconfirming something that has historically happened but may not happen again. So what I often find very common in a lot of problem solving is that we actually have confirmation bias. We're all actually looking just to confirm whatever finding or thought that we had before. Or we have groupthink, because the leader thinks something, therefore it must be right, and we all just kind of fall in line.

The most effective way for us to actually try and debias a bit is to sometimes have a challenger session. Your organization might call it something different, but it's to actually take whoever is a strong leader or a voice in one perspective and see if they can argue the other perspective and vice versa. It's sometimes a little bit funny, it can feel a little bit contrived, but it's an incredibly powerful way for us to make sure that we're actually checking our blind spots and that we're actually challenging ourselves also to be a bit more empathetic as leaders in our problem solving, so that we're not so grounded in and married to our own perspectives that we can't actually see what our counterparts might be thinking.

Biases can sometimes be hard to spot, so it’s important to inquire more deeply into habits of thought.

EMILY: I think biases happen all the time. And I would love to say that they're caught at the right time. I have an example of one where we caught the bias not at the very end, but definitely probably later than we would have liked. I happened to be the North American lead for Diversity for Asian-Americans at McKinsey.

And it's been interesting, because if you think about Asian-Americans in the most sort of holistic, generic sense you think about, typically, a group of people who are well-represented in higher education, in higher institutions of professional work. One of the classic things that we've known is that this is a population that does typically fairly well and is well-represented in the earlier 10 years. But interestingly, as you've probably heard the term ‘the bamboo ceiling’, a lot of folks can't make the transition into C-suite or senior roles. We see this predominantly across all the different types of Asians, and most acutely in women.

What was interesting to us is we thought, well, let's take a page out of the Blacks at McKinsey or the LGBT community at McKinsey or any other diverse group and look at the interventions that they used, and basically, see if they make sense, and apply them to ourselves. And one of the heuristics or biases that we had probably not explicitly stated was that we were very much like these other groups, that we too were a minority, that we could actually probably use a similar set of interventions to address the pain points.

What we actually discovered was that Asian-Americans are a completely different beast. Asian-Americans are different because what is an Asian-American? Is it Southeast Asia? Is it Central Asia?

And just through the sheer diaspora of Southeast Asia alone, you actually have very different ways that Asian-Americans from that region got to America.

Suffice to say, we had a set of interventions, we were very excited, about to roll them out, and only pausing to do a focus group did we realize, actually, the pain points that we're trying to solve, though on the surface they sounded similar, were actually fundamentally different. There was almost an instance where a shortcut that we thought could have been taken needed to be debiased because we actually realized that we didn't have the same problem statement that some of the other groups did.
