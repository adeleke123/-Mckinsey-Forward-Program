## What’s your learning intention?

It’s a fact: you will get more out of a learning experience if you go in with a clear intention.

Let’s set an intention for the experience ahead. To get you started, here are a few examples we have heard from others on their personal adaptability journeys. In case it sparks additional ideas, we have also included a reminder of the topics we will cover during this journey.

As a manager, I care deeply about my team as individuals and as a unit. We just adopted a new organizational structure, and many of us are working virtually. I want to help my teams continue to achieve their full potential in this new environment.


I want to live a long, healthy, happy life surrounded by the people I love, so I need to improve my ability to cope with stress in and out of the workplace.

I will set aside more time for professional development. Our industry is changing rapidly, and I want to learn about digital advances and how we can implement them in my organization.

### Reflection

What’s your learning intention for this adaptability and resilience journey?


Earlier in this course, you reflected on your personal learning journey and what your future might look like. Here are the sources of personal meaning you started to identify:
Being adaptable and resilient can unlock many opportunities and benefits in both your professional and personal life. For example, it can allow you to more easily navigate and overcome challenges and setbacks, and enable you to pivot and make necessary changes in order to achieve your goals. It can also help you to be more flexible and open to new ideas and approaches, which can lead to increased innovation and creativity. In terms of sources of personal meaning, it is important to identify the things that are most important to you and that will continuously guide and energize you. These may include your values, passions, and goals. It can also be helpful to reflect on the impact you want to have on others and the world around you, as well as the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. It is also important to consider what will keep you motivated when things get difficult. This may involve finding ways to stay focused on your long-term goals, seeking support and encouragement from others, and finding ways to manage stress and maintain a positive outlook. It may also involve setting smaller, achievable goals along the way to help keep you motivated and moving forward.

Continue to build on that meaning as you craft your learning intention. The more specific your intention can be, the better. In fact, consider breaking down your big learning intention into a smaller first intention. If you need inspiration, you can use the optional template below:
