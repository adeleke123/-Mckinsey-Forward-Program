## Reflect on a past interaction

Youâ€™ve seen and heard from experts on the benefits of defining the purpose of your interaction.

* Reflection


Think about the past interaction you identified in Section 2. In Section 2, we asked you to reflect on empathy in that interaction. Now consider Purpose:

+ Were you clear on the purpose of the interaction? What was the purpose? Which of the Purpose Archetypes applied to your interaction, if any?
+ Did you communicate the purpose up front?
+ Was the purpose shared? If so, how?
+ If it was not a shared purpose, what could you have done differently? What impact do you think that would have had on the outcome?
