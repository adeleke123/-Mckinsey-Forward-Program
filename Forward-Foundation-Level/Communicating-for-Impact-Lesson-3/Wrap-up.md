Hear from various McKinsey experts on how having a shared purpose can pave the way to impact.

KWEILIN ELLINGRUD: Having a clear purpose and making sure that everybody involved understands what that purposes is so critical. Otherwise, there can be mismanaged expectations, there can be just different expectations, and I think it can be harder to achieve the goal if you don't set it out explicitly from the very beginning.

SHAIL THAKER: I think purpose is a very interesting concept in the context of communication. You can have a purpose, but that purpose can sometimes be very egocentric, which is, this is my purpose in the conversation. I want to achieve this. This is what I want the audience to-- and communication is not a one-way street, so that purpose, at some point, has to become a shared purpose.

KWEILIN ELLINGRUD: When there are a number of different purposes at stake, I think the important thing is to start with where there is a common purpose. To define where you share that common ground and you all want the same elements, and then from there, moving to where there may be differing purpose or differing objectives that people are trying to get achieved to talk about those explicitly and highlight where there may be some trade offs.

SARA PRINCE: One of my favorite things for getting everybody on the same page around what the purpose of an interaction should be is really just to ask them and to actually visually capture it on a flip chart, on a Zoom screen, whatever the case may be so that you know upfront, are we all on the same page about what's the intended use of this interaction. And that doesn't mean that just by laying it out everybody gets to the same page, but you at least know quickly if you have alignment or if you don't. And then once you know if you have alignment, then you can really work through either moving forward or taking a moment to pause and get alignment before you move forward.

TOM KILROY: I think it's-- honestly, if you can't align on what you're there for, then it's good to know that up front. And if you need to, you should cancel the meeting, and then you should come back and say when we'll be able to come together on a purpose that we can all agree on, because if we can't, there's no reason for us to be here. And so I think just that mindset of, hey, before we even get started, we really need to just lay out and make sure that we're all on the same page in terms of what we're trying to do here, and then once we've got that, then we can start to work through the specifics of how we're going to get there together.
