## Introducing the Purpose Archetypes

Weâ€™ve established that ideally every interaction should focus on areas where everyone involved has a shared purpose. The purpose of a conversation should be as specific as possible, but it may fall into one of five example archetypes. Hilary Moore and Beth Lakin walk us through the Purpose Archetypes and illustrate how they can be applied in isolation or combination to move an audience to action.

HILARY MOORE: So the P in EPIC is all about purpose. Why are we doing what we are doing, and it seems like an obvious question, but actually, very often, we dive into communicating before we've thought through clearly what do we really want to achieve when we communicate with people?

BETH LAKIN: Now, every interaction has a purpose. Even coffee with your friends has a purpose. You want to share news, you want to connect with your friends, you want to relax and enjoy yourself. Sometimes, the purpose of a meeting is very tangible. It could be to sign off a business plan or to problem solve in the process, and sometimes it's less tangible but equally important, like building a relationship with someone.

Whichever it is for a meeting, the purpose needs to be specific. Even though the purpose of your meeting will be specific to the situation you're in, usually the purpose of a meeting will fall into one of five archetypes. Number one, it could be about understanding. This means ensuring that everybody involved understands and is aligned with the work that we've been asked to do.

HILARY MOORE: Another purpose archetype would be gathering ideas. So the classic for this is a brainstorm. Let's say you're kicking off an initiative and you want to have everybody involved and get all the ideas on the table. So you want to run a workshop that's really inclusive, encouraging everyone to get involved and share all the ideas. You're not at the point of filtering or prioritizing, you're just opening up the space to create possibilities.

BETH LAKIN: The third category would be rapport building. This would involve active listening, learning about concerns and motivations, and building a relationship. This is particularly important when you're working with someone for the first time. The fourth purpose is reassurance. Sometimes we need to build confidence in our audience that the project is on the right track, that the insights being developed are robust, and that we understand the context of the situation.

HILARY MOORE: Another really important purpose archetype is decision-making. So what are you actually going to do? Are you going to extend into China or won't you? What are the actions, who's going to do them, are you committed, the next step's by when.

It can be very easy to spend two hours in a meeting talking and sharing ideas and then you leave and you think, huh, did we actually come to a conclusion? That's a common pitfall. So if you keep focused on that as a purpose, the archetype purpose is this is about decision making. It can really help you get the results you need.

BETH LAKIN: Often, when we plan a meeting, we'll find that we have more than one purpose. Sometimes, we'll end up with three, four, or even five different objectives. Things we'd like to achieve during the meeting, and this is particularly true when we also think about the audience and what they'd like to get out of the discussion. But naturally, we don't always have time to cover all of those different objectives, so it's important to prioritize.

It can be helpful to list out your purposes in order of importance, and then think about which of these which you most want to achieve and which maybe could be delayed till later or covered off in a different format, like maybe with a pre-read or a side meeting or a second meeting instead.
