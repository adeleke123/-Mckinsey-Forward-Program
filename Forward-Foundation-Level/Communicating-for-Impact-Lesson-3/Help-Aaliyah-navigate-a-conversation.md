## Getting aligned on the agenda

In this section, you've learned how to define the purpose of an interaction taking into account the audience's needs and yours. Now it’s your turn to practice by advising Aaliyah. Read the scenario below and start the conversation.

Aaliyah is planning the agenda for the upcoming Transformation Office kickoff meeting she'll be leading, and she wants to get Noah's inputs. As Head of Digital at MODA, Noah and his department will be driving the execution of the digital transformation. Both Aaliyah and Noah want the kickoff next week to go smoothly, but each are very busy trying to manage their own priorities to ensure everyone involved is prepared.

+ OK, great. Thanks for your suggestion! I'll take it into account as I'm finalizing the agenda. I agree it might make sense to swap the last two items around.

+ Wow, I wasn't aware of those challenges, but I can certainly understand how they could be top-of-mind. Maybe we can cover them at a later time? I'd love to keep this meeting focused on building the team.


+ Wow, thanks so much for that context. My instinct is to keep the meeting focused on team building though. These issues are common during a transformation kickoff and it's important to remain focused on our priorities for next week. Are you open to that?

+ Wow, I wasn't aware of those challenges, but I can certainly understand how they could be top-of-mind. Let's shift the focus of the meeting away from team-building a bit to give these topics more time if that will make everyone happy.

## Review the following information. Then select the best answer and click Submit.


+ In order to keep the meeting on track, let's stay away from any contentious topics that could derail us. It's important to ensure we cover critical items for next week. I'm happy to answer questions if they arise though. Will that work?

+ Let's set some time aside toward the end for any questions people may have—that will give everyone an opportunity to raise any key concerns so there are no distractions next week. We can also have a follow-up meeting later if there's a need, but let's stay focused on project launch. Does that sound good?
We could start by addressing key concerns up front for a few minutes. Maybe you can help me rein in any questions going off topic? Let's also announce a follow-up meeting next week to address any outstanding concerns we can't answer on the spot. How does that sound?
