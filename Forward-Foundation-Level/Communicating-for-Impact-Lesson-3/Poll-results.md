## Compare with your peers

Most of us focus far more on what we want to get out of an interaction rather than on the other person. It may be easier to focus on ourselves, but the fact is, it doesn’t lead to meaningful connections. It may lead to something transactional, at best.

When you think about purpose, always ask yourself, “What do I want to get out of this specific interaction?” and “What does the other person want to get out of it?” A shared purpose is a crucial step to success. Next, challenge yourself and ask: “Is this the right meeting at the right time, with the right people to achieve it?” Then you can tailor the insights you bring to the meeting to help you achieve your purpose.
