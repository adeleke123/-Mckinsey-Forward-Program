## What are your learning intentions?

Setting a learning intention can be most useful when building new skills and knowledge. Make some concrete learning intentions related to Purpose looking ahead. If you havenâ€™t done so already, please download the CFI Learning Intentions workbook to do so. This will allow you to track your intentions and save them as a takeaway at the end of the course.
