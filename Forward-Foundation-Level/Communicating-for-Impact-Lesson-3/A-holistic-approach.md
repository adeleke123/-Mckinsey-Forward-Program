## Heads, Hearts, Hands
Why is it important to think about your audience holistically? Hilary Moore and Mary Lass Stewart describe what it means to meet objectives by taking into consideration heads, hearts, and hands.

HILARY MOORE: Head, heart, and hands is a great simple framework to help you think more deeply about what you want to achieve in a meeting or for a presentation.

MARY LASS STEWART: Why do we need a framework like that? Well, it provides you a structured way to think about what's important to the people that you'll be engaging with, and also what's important for you and your team to get out of the conversation.

HILARY MOORE: It basically splits out your objective into three main categories. So let me take you through those. Head is what do you want people to think or know as a result of your communication. Hand is what do you want them to do as a result, and I think most importantly, heart is how do you want them to feel as a result.

I think it's pretty much really useful, because quite often, we have the pitfall of only thinking about the head. So I'm giving a presentation I need to pass on information, but very often, there are objectives in addition to that. I want to excite people. Inspire them. That would be a heart objective, or I actually want them to go out and do something afterwards, maybe lead an initiative, or tell other people about something, and that would be a hand initiative.

MARY LASS STEWART: You might want them to feel excited about where you're going. You might want them to feel the gravity of the situation that you might be outlining to them. That might be a more serious feeling, but no matter what, feelings are really great motivators, and they tap into what's most important to people. So they're not something that you want to leave out of the conversation.

HILARY MOORE: So let's say you're preparing for your meeting and you want to use heads, hearts, and hands. What I'd suggest is you find one or two objectives under each of those categories. Again, too many is just going to be impossible to achieve and you won't know where to focus. So the best way to bring this alive is with an example.

Recently, I was working with an executive team of a power company, and the power company was in quite a lot of trouble. It was struggling against lots of socioeconomic challenges, and the company was actually in jeopardy of going under, and we were having a kickoff meeting for the transformation with the executive team. So under the heads objective, it was really about making sure they had the hard figures to make it clear how bad the situation was, but also that they understood fully the methodology of the transformation that we were recommending they go through.

Under hearts, what we felt before the meeting was that there was a lack of belief that they could actually fix the problem. They were change tired, so we needed something to push more energy in and get them to take commitment and ownership. So as part of that meeting, we actually took them to the historic site where their company had first opened. It was about 120 years before, and we got them to see their commitments to each other as a team for what they do, and we found that really gave an impetus of energy.

We also brought case studies of successful transformations to help them believe and be inspired about the possibilities. Finally, the hands, what are they going to do. We needed them to leave that kickoff with a clear action list and clear owners. So the last hour of the meeting was devoted to doing that with them and making sure they all left there knowing exactly what they were going to do. That would be an example of applying head, heart, and hands framework when you're planning a meeting to make sure you really achieve what you most need to do.
