* Reflection

## The next time you’re debating an issue, considering next steps, or making some other important decision, ask yourself or your team how you can improve your approach. Data can’t tell you what to do. It can help answer questions, but only if you ask the right questions.

+ Use existing data or identify additional data that can improve your analysis.
+ Integrate learnings from data into your next steps.
+ Treat an iteration that did not lead to the right solution as a new data point on the way to a better solution, rather than calling it failure.

Think about an upcoming work decision or dilemma. What is one thing you can do to make a more data-driven decision?
