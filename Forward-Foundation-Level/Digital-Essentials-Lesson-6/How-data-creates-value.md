Flip each card to see how Victor’s actions correlate to one media streaming company’s approach to data.

## Starting and pausing a show


+ Victor explores the app on his tablet to find his favorite show, a true crime documentary. At dinnertime, he can pause the show.

## Collecting and storing data

+ Every time Victor navigates the website, he creates data points such as his IP address, watch history, and search queries, which are saved in the cloud. Data is then forwarded to a data warehouse that can hold, move, and transform massive quantities of data.

## Continuing the show

+ The next day, during his workout, Victor continues watching the most recent episode on his cell phone.


## Requesting data

+ Victor can switch seamlessly across devices because the company keeps a user profile of his activities across devices and integrates them into one record that is synced across devices and stored in the cloud.

## Recommending new shows

+ A few weeks later, Victor wants to watch a similar show, so he searches for new content.

## Analyzing data

+ The streaming company uses machine learning to predict Victor’s preferences based on data from his activities and those of other users, and from data collected outside the platform. The system incorporates new data as Victor generates it.
