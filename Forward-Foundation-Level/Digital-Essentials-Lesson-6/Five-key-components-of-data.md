## Five key components of data

A company needs a holistic approach to data to provide users like Victor with the convenience and customized service they expect—and to prevent any misuse of his data.

A holistic approach includes five components: data strategy, data architecture, data governance, data culture, and data ethics. A good data strategy—the organization’s approaches to data collection and management—is informed by overall business strategy.

In this course, we focus on the four remaining components that are more likely to be a part of your day-to-day experience: data architecture, data governance, data culture, and data ethics.

## Data strategy

+ Data strategy identifies the organization's overall approach to data sources and formats, including a strategic plan to build data capabilities.

+ For the streaming company, this means selecting the right data so customers can begin watching a show on one device and continue on another. This also enables accurate recommendations on other shows to watch. The company also needs to specify data sources and formats, and the sequence of data capture.

## Data architecture

+ Data architecture refers to the “pipes” that generate, store, integrate, and distribute the data that enables an experience.

+ The streaming company collects most of its data from its own website, but it processes the data through cloud databases and other web services. This allows the company to track unique profiles and know the preferences of each viewer.

## Data governance

+ Data governance includes organizational processes and guidelines to manage data and maintain quality.

+ The streaming company gives employees incentives to adhere to their data guidelines, and it offers employees the tools and support they need to capture, manage, and use high-quality data correctly.

## Data culture

+ Data culture reflects employees’ mindsets as they use data to make decisions. In a healthy data culture, people treat data as a strategic asset, and they visualize, gather, analyze, and interpret data to achieve organizational objectives.

+ The streaming company encourages employees to safely experiment using data, guided by clear success metrics. They place a high value on employees who demonstrate good judgment and use data to generate insights that inform their decisions.

## Data ethics

+ Data ethics refers to regulations and policy guardrails when dealing with data—especially personal data.

+ The streaming company needs to define and meet data ethical standards, like how to anonymize their customers’ data. Beyond data management, they must consider other ethical issues such as how to curate content or restrict access to minors.
