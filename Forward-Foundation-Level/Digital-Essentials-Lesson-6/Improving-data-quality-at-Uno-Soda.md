## Improving data quality at Uno Soda

Let’s explore some of the difficulties Uno Soda is having with their data from the perspectives of data architecture, data governance, data culture, and data ethics.

##Data architecture
Gordon, a merchandiser at Uno Soda, wants to use data to improve the accuracy of his weekly stock predictions. But this isn’t possible with Uno Soda’s current data architecture, which defines where data is generated, stored, integrated, and distributed.

“To make the most accurate predictions, I need a view of data in my region that combines in-store and online sales. On my regular dashboard, I can see data on each store, but I get the online data from a separate report in a different format, so I have to combine the two data sets myself using an Excel spreadsheet. That takes extra time, but my weekly stock predictions are more accurate now.”

+ Reach out to the data architecture team to see if there’s a faster way to get the combined data sets he needs.
+ Make predictions based on the regular dashboard data, and check the online report only every couple of months instead of weekly.

## Data governance

Data governance includes the organizational processes and guidelines that manage data and maintain quality.

Danielle, the inventory control specialist, notices soda inventory mistakes across multiple stores. Uno Soda’s process for updating inventory is clunky and prone to errors, which prevents the store from restocking the right sodas. Danielle wonders if it is her responsibility to maintain data quality.

## What can the Uno Soda team do to fix this problem?


Choose your response and select submit.

+ The Uno Soda employee who designed the inventory data collection process should use design thinking to improve the inventory reporting process.
+ Uno Soda’s IT team should improve the design of the tool used for tracking inventory.
+ Uno Soda should provide stockers at each store with a straightforward guide indicating how to accurately input and track the latest inventory.
+ All of the above.

## Data culture

Across Uno Soda, merchandisers like Gordon, who distribute sodas to each store, are not consistent in how they use data tools. Because inventory software is slow or difficult to use, some merchandisers rely on instincts to make decisions or use the workarounds they created when the data wasn’t syncing properly.

## Even a perfect data strategy will not yield long-lasting improvements without the data culture to support it. All employees must understand why data is important and how they can use it to contribute to success.

## Data ethics

An organization with a healthy data culture prioritizes data ethics to avoid situations that may violate regulations or cause harm to end users, the organization, or other stakeholders.

Managers at Uno Soda ask three main questions when dealing with data on an operational level:

+ Am I handling sensitive information, such as credit card data, that needs protection?
+ Am I aware of my responsibility to maintain accuracy when capturing data?
+ Do I always use secure channels and platforms when storing and communicating data?
+ Beyond answering these questions, all employees must understand the topics of data privacy, transparency, biases, and interference to recognize dilemmas before they become problems.
