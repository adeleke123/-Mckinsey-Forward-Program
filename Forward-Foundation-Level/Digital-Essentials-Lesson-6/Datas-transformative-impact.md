## Data’s transformative impact

Using data strategically can transform not only how people work but influence an entire industry.

The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) captures and integrates ocean data to provide researchers with an unprecedented ability to study the world's oceans and climate.

## Their challenge

+ Emerging technology in ocean science is broadening research possibilities, but the scientific community needs access to more high-quality data. Vast amounts of research data are kept in silos, preventing scientists and government officials from collaborating and building on their findings. So in addition to collecting data, OOI aims to provide it to the public.
+ The OOI's goals include delivering data using a scalable architecture that can allow researchers to harness emerging technical advances in ocean science.

## Their data strategy and approach

+ The OOI and its partners are working to democratize ocean observations and models. To maximize transparency, they provide guidance on how they communicate changes to the data.
+ The Institute uses distributed data centers and cloud computing to store a vast amount of data.
Their data architecture includes standardizing how they catalogue measurements and define common data formats. Users can choose from three common formats, making the data more accessible.
+ The OOI encourages researchers to use the data to create proposals that can lead to data-driven decision making. Anyone with internet access can use the OOI’s custom tools to explore, use, and visualize its data.
+ The volume of data continues to grow, so the OOI implemented a standardized process to monitor data quality from the moment it is collected to the latest use cases.

## Resulting impact
+ As of 2020, OOI had used more than 800 instruments and sensors to collect 36 terabytes of data.
+ Universities, governments, and other public institutions can use OOI’s high-quality data for educational or research purposes, enhancing humanity’s abilities to address critical issues such as climate change and ocean acidification.
+ Already, over 80 research projects have started with the help of OOI data.
