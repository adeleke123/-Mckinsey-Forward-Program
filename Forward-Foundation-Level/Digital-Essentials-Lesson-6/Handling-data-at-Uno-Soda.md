Now that you know more about the power of data, let’s revisit Uno Soda. The number of its customers buying sodas online has risen by 5% since the company launched its new personalized landing page. But online customers’ flavor preference data is siloed from in-store purchasing data, so many customers can’t find their preferred flavors in local stores. Uno Soda wants to create a seamless multi-channel experience that spans the website and stores.
