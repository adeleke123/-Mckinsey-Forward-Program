## What are the behaviors of effective learners?

Having just examined some truths and myths about habits, you might be asking, well, what should I focus on? Let’s start with healthy learning behaviors, the building blocks of habits. Once you understand those good behaviors, you can then turn your energy into making them automatic.

We think of learning behaviors in three big categories. Ask yourself which of the following areas is your biggest opportunity for improvement and then go through the specific learning behaviors below. If you are inspired, read them all!

+ `Preparation`: Am I investing the time and energy I need to set myself up for success?
+ `Execution`: Am I learning and performing to the best of my capabilities … and enjoying myself?
+ `Reflection`: Am I learning from my past actions?

+ `Preparation`
Investing the time and energy to set yourself up for success


### Set an intention and start small

+ Set a learning intention and then break it down into subcomponents

Start with a learning intention—what do you want to be able to do? Setting an intention makes it more likely that the learning will happen and that you will enjoy yourself in the process. When the overall goal seems overwhelming, break it into smaller parts. This will allow you to get started more quickly and help you maintain momentum—small accomplishments provide a rush of dopamine, giving you the motivation to continue.

### Plan and prioritize regular practice, your way

+ Organize your learning to create focused space and time in your schedule

Make learning a priority by breaking out the steps you will need to take and including them in your schedule as “must-dos” rather than as optional activities. By taking ownership over your learning, you will satisfy your human need for autonomy. When we do things our way, we feel rewarded.

### Anticipate roadblocks

+ Think ahead to possible obstacles and continue to calibrate

Before engaging in an activity, imagine the challenges you might face, whether it is a matter of skill (ability to do it), will (desire to do it), or opportunity (chance to do it). More importantly, consider how you will work around anticipated challenges. This kind of proactive behavior will help you learn more efficiently in new contexts.

+ `Execution`
Learning and performing to the best of your capabilities, and enjoying yourself in the process

### Practice deliberately and on the edge

+ Focus your activity at just the right level of challenge to extend expertise

Our most important learning experiences come from prolonged engagement in a challenging process. As humans, we are wired to enjoy this process, so don’t run from it! Challenging yourself (on the highest priority things) actually helps you to build confidence. The important part is finding a balance so that the task is difficult enough to remain interesting but not so difficult that it discourages you from continuing or experimenting with new ideas—it should be just on the edge.

### Teach others

+ Share what you know with others

One of the best ways for our brains to process information is to teach it to someone else. Teaching helps overcome the common phenomenon of thinking we have learned something when actually we have only been exposed to the information.

### Be mindful

+ Master the art of paying close attention

Learning is a continuous process of collecting information, evaluating it in context, trying new things, and considering alternatives. The art of really paying attention, and not learning “on autopilot,” can help us do this better (and make learning more interesting!).

+ `Reflection`
Learning from your past actions

### Give and receive feedback

+ Establish a feedback loop to refine your new skills

Sometimes we need additional perspectives on how we’re doing, especially with skills others can see, like communication, managing others, etc. Ask for feedback from those around you, and use it to enhance your learning.

### Question your assumptions

+ Self-examine often

We can prevent our learning from falling into disrepair by addressing what psychologists call self-serving bias. This is our tendency to accept greater-than-deserved praise for our successes and to deflect blame for our failures. Self-examination forces us to hold up the mirror instead of taking the information that suits us and ignoring that which does not.

### Take time to reflect

+ Dedicate active time to think about what you are learning and what it means

Reflection is the mechanism that turns experiences into lasting learning. By taking the time to process learning we can continually refine our understanding and skills. Without reflection, even the most powerful experiences will eventually fade from memory.

Not sleeping enough makes it impossible to pay optimal attention and learn. 
One study found that when people average four hours of sleep a night for four or five days, 
they develop the same level of cognitive impairment as if 
they’d been awake for 24 hours—the 
equivalent of being legally drunk in some countries. 
Within ten days, the level of impairment matches that of going 48 hours without sleep. 
Sleep deprivation greatly lengthens reaction time, impedes judgment, and interferes with problem solving.

Good sleep is also critical to strengthening and solidifying memories—it helps learning stick. 
During certain stages of sleep, 
your hippocampus (the part of your brain associated with learning and forming new memories) 
talks to the neocortex which helps encode and strengthen long-term memory.
