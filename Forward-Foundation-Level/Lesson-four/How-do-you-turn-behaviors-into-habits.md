## How do you turn behaviors into habits?

Research says it takes about one to two months of practicing a behavior to make it a habit, but habit formation is about more than just time. The key to establishing healthy habits or getting rid of bad ones is to understand how habits form and persist, and then to take deliberate actions to make behaviors truly stick.

Once you have identified the learning habit you want to form—for example, giving and receiving feedback—you can make the behavior stick by applying the three components of the Habit Loop: cues, routines, and rewards.

Starting with Cue, click on each spyglass icon below to learn more about how you can incorporate these practices. We are focusing on the habit of giving and receiving feedback as an example.

## The Habit Loop

`Reward`
## What will your reward be? What will make you feel good about your routine?
+ In approaching feedback as a learning habit, the feedback itself might be the reward.
+ But you should also consider other physical, mental, or emotional rewards. 
+ Are you someone who has a “happy” folder in your inbox so you have a set of reminders to make you smile?
+ Maybe your reward is just the satisfaction of being able to mark that big X on your calendar.
+ Or maybe it is something tangible. Order yourself that new book you have been meaning to read, or maybe that stylish new bag for work.

`Cue`
## What’s the reminder? In other words, what cue will trigger your habit?
+ You might set an electronic reminder: for example, a calendar invite that pops up at the start of every week.
+ You might try a physical note or object, like a reminder you place by your desk. 
+ Or perhaps you have a calendar out in the open, featuring an X on every day that you gave or received feedback.

`Routine`
## What’s the routine? What steps do you need to take to follow through on this habit?
+ Perhaps you set aside time for feedback in your standing meetings.
+ Maybe you reach out to a new person each week to ask for feedback and a different person to give feedback.
+ In addition to putting the habit into practice, maybe you also set aside a little time to read articles, 
+ watch videos, and reflect on the roadblocks you might encounter and how you could solve them.

 `Turbocharge with meaning`

```
Throughout this process, you have the opportunity to turbocharge your habit formation by 
connecting it to sources of meaning. 
Choose a habit that truly resonates with you and get clear on why it’s important. 
For example, feedback is an opportunity to build connections with your colleagues, 
whose futures you care about. It is also an opportunity for continuous personal improvement.
