## How do you turn behaviors into habits?

Research says it takes about one to two months of practicing a behavior to make it a habit, but habit formation is about more than just time. The key to establishing healthy habits or getting rid of bad ones is to understand how habits form and persist, and then to take deliberate actions to make behaviors truly stick.

Once you have identified the learning habit you want to form—for example, giving and receiving feedback—you can make the behavior stick by applying the three components of the Habit Loop: cues, routines, and rewards.

Starting with Cue, click on each spyglass icon below to learn more about how you can incorporate these practices. We are focusing on the habit of giving and receiving feedback as an example.
