## What’s your advice?

Raising our consciousness about our own behaviors every day (a habit in and of itself) makes it more likely that we’ll unlearn our unhealthy habits, form better ones, and continue to revisit what’s going well and what needs work.

We can start by hearing from some others about how learning habits are playing out in their lives, and considering what advice we would share with them.

I have the tendency to approach new things with a lot of energy and big intentions. 
Last year I bought a bike and signed up for an 80-kilometer charity ride. 
This is a good time to mention that I wasn’t a regular bike rider, 
but I was really excited. Needless to say, 
I didn’t participate in the charity ride 
in the end—I just wasn’t ready to ride that far. 
Here’s the wake-up call: 
I see how I do the same exact thing in the workplace. 
When it’s time to learn something new, 
I tend to jump in and start way too big. 
I bite off more than I can chew, and 
then don’t finish things, or get frustrated. 
For example, I just started to roll out a new global campaign … 
and I’m already thinking I should have focused on 
starting with just one business unit.

+ I agree with your focus on trying to start smaller. It doesn’t mean you are losing sight of your bigger intentions—it means you are breaking them down into smaller subcomponents.

+ You should keep jumping in and thinking big—your organization needs your enthusiasm. I would suggest scheduling more regular check-ins with your manager so you can discuss your progress and how you can stay motivated even when you feel overwhelmed.

I am one of those people who actually likes giving and receiving feedback. 
Just the other day, my colleague shared with me how much they appreciate 
that I always take the time to reflect at the end of projects, 
to think about what went well and what could have been better. 
However, they also shared with me that both my team and 
I would benefit from doing a better job of anticipating roadblocks. 
That was fair feedback—this project did not go particularly well. 
Now I am prioritizing focusing on this for the rest of the quarter

+ Re-frame the idea of anticipating roadblocks as pro-active reflection. This would be a natural extension of the importance Aaron places on feedback and reflection.
		
+ Conduct formal pre-mortems at the kick-offs for upcoming projects.

		
+ Build time into weekly check-ins with the team to do this in smaller but more consistent ways throughout the project.

## Meet Freya

`Listen to her experience`

```
I developed a new habit this year: every month, 
I schedule a ‘What’s working?’ meeting, with myself. 
I ask myself a few simple questions: 
what’s bringing me energy? 
What am I most proud of? What might I try differently? 
It has been helpful to uncover what is actually going well, 
but also to push and question my own assumptions. 
For example, it has taken me a few months of reflection, 
but I’m realizing that I have not actually been pushing myself to try new things.

### What could you suggest that would truly push Freya’s learning to the next level?


* Select the best answer and click Submit.


+ Your focus on strengths is so important—so often we only spend time thinking about what needs to be fixed. Don’t forget to reward yourself!


+ I love the idea of the “What’s working?” meeting—I would benefit from a similar habit. In addition to the self-questioning, have you thought about building more experimentation into your routine? You could focus on one or two actions to test each month. Even if they do not seem to go well, at least you will learn from the experience.
