* Reflection


## Start by choosing which behavior you’ll focus on.

+ How will you truly make this new behavior a habit?
+ Determine how you’ll remind yourself (i.e., what cue will trigger your habit? An electronic reminder? A physical note or object? A specific meeting?).
+ Outline the routine (i.e., what will the habit look like in action?).
+ Choose a reward (i.e., what will make you feel good about your routine? Maybe a physical reward, or a mental or emotional one—connected to the experience itself?).
+ Why is this habit meaningful to you?
+ How will you ensure you are maintaining this habit?
+ What might you need to unlearn?
