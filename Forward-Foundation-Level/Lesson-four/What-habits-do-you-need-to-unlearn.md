## What habits do you need to unlearn?

You have explored what positive learning behaviors are and how you can turn them into habits. There is also an important flip side to forming new habits: unlearning old habits.

In the same way we know which habits support learning, we know which do not. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to provide an easy opportunity to check in with yourself: which habits might be holding you back? Which habits might you unlearn in order to make space for new, healthier habits?

## Habits

+ `Cramming`: amassing a lot of information in a short period of time leads to superficial processing.
+ `Poor diet`: inadequate nutrition can hamper attention, memory, and learning.
+ `Lack of sleep/exercise`: physical exhaustion and a sedentary lifestyle are detrimental to attention, encoding of information, and motivation.
+ `Poor time management`: lack of prioritization leads to little time and space to learn.
+ `Procrastination`: postponing tasks will delay the learning process and make it more daunting.
```
Unhealthy execution
Are you learning and performing to the best of your capabilities â€¦ and enjoying yourself?

```
## Habits

+ `Performance first`: the need to always show competence and expertise detracts from effective learning.
+ `Self-sabotaging/handicapping`: not trying hard enough is sometimes a symptom of fear of failure.
+ `Imitation`: trying to do something because others are doing it and for their approval is mentally and emotionally exhausting.
+ `Autopilot mode`: not being deliberate about the choices you make robs you of ownership of your learning, as well as the enjoyment and the effectiveness of the process.

```
Unhealthy reflection
Are you learning from your past actions?
```
## Habits

+ `Self-serving attributions`: not taking responsibility for failures and overestimating your role in successes undermines your ability to learn.
+ `Lone wolf`: doing things alone and never asking for help is a way to stifle your learning potential.
