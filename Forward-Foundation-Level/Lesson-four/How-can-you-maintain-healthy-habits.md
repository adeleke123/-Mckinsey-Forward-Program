## How can you maintain healthy habits?

Habits are like cars—they work well when they’re new but require care and upkeep to keep running smoothly. Making time to deliberately review your learning habits is like servicing a car—replacing older, outdated parts with new ones so the overall system functions as effectively as possible.

Three actions can help you be your own “habit mechanic.”

Flip each card to learn about each action.

## Examine and question

The more you stop and investigate your learning habits, the more deeply you learn, and the more you build your self-confidence. Ask yourself:

+ What am I learning right now?
+ How am I learning it?
+ Which habits do I have?

## Analyze your patterns

If you pay close attention, themes will emerge. Ask yourself:

+ What patterns am I noticing?
+ What is working well that I should continue?
+ What is not, and how might I try a different approach?

## Consider alternative perspectives

It is easy to fall into the trap of self-serving bias, which can bring on near-sightedness and negative patterns of behavior. Ask yourself:

+ What assumptions am I making?
+ What else should I consider?
+ If others observed my learning habits, what feedback might they offer?
