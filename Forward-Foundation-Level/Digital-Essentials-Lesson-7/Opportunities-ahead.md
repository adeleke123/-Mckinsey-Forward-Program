The future is uncertain, but it is certainly digital.

Many recent advances in climate science, medicine, engineering, art and entertainment are driven by advances in data, analytics, and technology.

As digital technologies become more interconnected, changes amplify one another, and new opportunities are born.

Many of the job roles that are common now were the stuff of science fiction just a generation ago.

Consider self-driving cars. Advancements in analytics, sensor technology, cloud storage, and artificial intelligence are making autonomous driving and connected transportation a reality.

Imagine the lives that can be saved. Imagine the reduction in carbon emissions that can be achieved.

The rate of change is accelerating, but what remains true is the importance of investing in the human capabilities that enable us to collaborate ethically, creatively, and sustainably with emerging technologies.

In the case of self-driving cars, people will have to decide how much autonomy the cars should have. People will design the policies that regulate privacy, safety and accountability.

To engage with the complex questions that arise from going digital, you must continuously update your knowledge and skills.

But your digital toolkit must also include the mindsets that will equip you to thrive in an era of change. As surprising new technologies emerge and new skills are required, the way you approach challenges is crucial.

Stay curious . Ask questions, challenge current constraints, and build on your knowledge.

Embrace iteration. Consider your efforts as something that, with new feedback and insights, can always be improved in the next version.

View the world as a place of abundance. Seek new opportunities, share knowledge with your colleagues, and learn with your community.

Envision how to make these mindsets work for you. When you are faced with unexpected changes in the world around you, how will you answer the call to action?

What choices will you make?
