## Audio Transcript
```
I’m a lead pharmacist at a large regional hospital network. As my organization transitions to digital health records and electronic prescriptions, my team has been asked to pilot new software and new ways of working. While I think this initiative can help us reduce manual errors and improve our patient experience, my team is conservative when it comes to embracing new technologies. I have extensive pharmaceutical knowledge and close relationships with my direct reports, but I’ve never worked on an Agile team. So I need to balance my own learning with leading my team.

`Meet Aaron`

Aaron, a mining safety and health specialist, is adjacent to transformation teams, and may be pulled in as a subject-matter expert. He is unsure of digital’s value, given his experiences with how change is implemented at his company.

## Audio Transcript
```
I’m a mining safety and health specialist. While I’m not actively part of a digital initiative, I know my expertise will be needed because industry benchmarks have shown that going digital meaningfully improves safety. To be honest, I’m a bit skeptical about this process. Even though improving safety is an organization-wide goal, we struggle to work across department silos. The initiative loses steam, and we go back to how we used to work before. If we can’t solve this culture issue, I feel like investing time into going digital will create more work and erode faith in the company’s growth strategy.

`Meet Elaine`


Elaine manages small business accounts at a large bank. She thinks going digital will make her better at her job, but she worries that she will lose her personal connection with clients.

## Audio Transcript
```
I am an account manager for small businesses at a large bank. I think going digital will eventually make us all more effective, but right now, my biggest concern is that the new client management tool will diminish the personal connection I’ve cultivated with my clients over the years. It’s our customer service that distinguishes us from other banks, so I’m worried that there will be a negative impact as we prototype the new tool.
