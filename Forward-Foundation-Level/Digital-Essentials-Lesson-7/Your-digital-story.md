## Your digital story

You have learned that you play an essential role in helping your organization go digital. Reflecting on your digital story—the focus of this course—can help you personalize your learning and clarify how you want to contribute.

## Why it matters

Research shows that to change our behavior, it’s not enough to change our environment. We also have to change the stories we tell ourselves and tell others about ourselves. Perhaps you’ve struggled to adopt new technology, or you’ve felt ambivalent about changing how you work. Reframing this narrative can help you adopt new mindsets and influence your actions.

In this course, you’ll create a digital story that connects what you’ve learned with your motivations and goals. Each reflection will link together to create a complete narrative, concluding with an immediate action step.
