`What will Sam do next?`

This week I will set up one-on-one meetings with my colleague who is leading the transition to electronic prescriptions. I want to consider what impact this will have on my team, so I can address any concerns as soon as possible. Next week, I will model prioritizing professional development, share what I’ve learned so far, and offer similar learning opportunities to my direct reports.

`What will Aaron do next?`

As a first step, I’ll attend trainings to better understand how digital transformation impacts my role. I’ll build relationships with people who are actively part of the digital transformation. If I can understand why people have been reluctant to embrace change in the past and understand my role now, I think I can have more impact in terms of improving workplace safety.

It will feel incredibly rewarding to have contributed to our organization's digital transformation and to have played a key role in its continued success.

`What will Elaine do next?`

As a first step, I’ll gather feedback from my clients, so I better understand what we do well and where there is more opportunity for improvement. I want to come to brainstorming meetings with some data that can shape how we improve our new client management system.
