Of course, you don’t have to be an athlete to benefit from visualization. It can help you articulate your goals and increase your chances of achieving those goals.

The first part of your story is below. Consider what you wrote previously before adding to your story.

Where were you before starting this journey?

Before starting this program, I felt uncertain about my organization going digital because I lacked a clear understanding of the benefits of digitalization and the steps required to implement it successfully. At the beginning of the program, I wanted to learn how to develop a digital transformation strategy, identify the necessary tools and technologies to implement it, and effectively manage the change process within my organization. Additionally, I hoped to gain insight into how digitalization can improve our business operations, enhance customer experience, and increase profitability.

## Reflection
Before writing down your reflection, try outcome visualization—creating a mental image of yourself achieving your goal.

Imagine what success in your organization looks like. Based on what you know, how can improving your digital skills contribute to your professional goals? What will it look like to achieve the impact you want? Who will you have impacted? What will it feel like to reach your goals?

After considering these questions, close your eyes and visualize achieving your goal. Now jot down your vision.
