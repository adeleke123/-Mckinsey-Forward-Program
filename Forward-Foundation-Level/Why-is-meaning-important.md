## Why is meaning important?

Learning is always more powerful when it is connected to a personal “why.” Let’s hear more about the impact of linking our learning to sources of personal meaning.

### Video transcript

Our pianist, Paola, is a finance manager by day, and her supervisor has asked her to select new finance software to modernize their IT systems. While Paola understands the project is necessary, it just doesn't excite her. She even worries she could fail given how little she knows about it, but as soon as she recognizes that this is an opportunity to decrease the stress her team is experiencing, her motivation increases.

With a clear link to something that is personally meaningful—the well-being of her team—the task at hand feels less daunting and more worthwhile. So Paula sets a clear learning intention for herself—be able to articulate the technical differences between the software options so that both she and her team can make an informed decision.

She sets up time with various vendors to better understand how the various software functions and then does further research on her top choices. The more she learns about the new software, the more ways she sees how this can improve her team members' lives, which in turn energizes her. When Paola takes the pressure off herself to offer a quick recommendation and recognizes she should spend time learning and exploring, the task becomes easier and more fun. After a few weeks and with her team's input, she is able to select the software with competence, and the entire finance team is excited about the eventual rollout.

The research is clear that performing in the long run requires you to release performance goals in the early stages in order to focus on your learning. And the research is clear about something else, too—that the best learning intentions are the ones that are linked to meaning. When we have to learn something difficult and over a longer period of time, it's critical to be intrinsically motivated. Think about the last time you engaged in an activity that you truly enjoyed and that was personally rewarding. There was no prize, threat, or external factor influencing your behavior. Only this heartwarming feeling inside of you. That's intrinsic motivation.

It makes us feel more empowered and in charge of our experience because it touches on our deep human need for autonomy—to choose where we focus our energy. Being able to see the task at hand as connected to something important to you is a powerfully different way to learn. In Paola’s case, her ability to make an explicit connection between learning about new software technology and realizing it would improve things for her team motivated her brain to focus and engage deeply in the activities involved. In turn, this makes learning easier, and you are more likely to successfully achieve your intention.
