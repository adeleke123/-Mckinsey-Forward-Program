## Reframing mistakes

Mistakes—and in some cases actual failure—are a necessary part of learning. The more mistakes we make, the more data and feedback we collect, the more we learn, and the more likely we are to come up with groundbreaking ideas. Yet, so often, we fear this kind of risk-taking. We fear that we may look incompetent or like we’re not doing our job, that other people will judge us, or that we might harm the team. What if we could reframe mistakes from being shameful or reflective of our personal character to opportunities to grow and adapt?

## How can we reframe mistakes?

### What good looks like

+ Acknowledge that mistakes happen.
+ Avoid showing anger when they happen.
+ Help team members correct mistakes.


### What great looks like

+ Share your own mistakes vulnerably and often.
+ Remind team members frequently that our work is complex, and that we should expect mistakes.
+ Reframe mistakes as steps in a longer journey—valuable data we can work with, and an opportunity to learn.

`Did you know?`

```
Have you ever written on a Post-it note? Taken penicillin? 
Used a plastic bottle? Played with a Slinky? Probably. 
But did you know that none of these were invented on purpose? 
In fact, in the case of the Post-it, 
its creator was trying to do the exact opposite: 
create a super-strong adhesive. 
Imagine what you and your team are capable of creating 
if you were to truly embrace a process of discovery 
for what it always is: an opportunity to learn. 
Who knows, that next “mistake” 
you make might actually lead 
to a breakthrough you never expected.
