## Coaching other team members to help and support each other

In addition to holding ourselves accountable for how we each contribute to a psychologically safe team, we should also encourage and coach others to do the same. Psychological safety is truly a team sport! As we move from individual actions to having an ongoing and shared team conversation, we raise our expectations for one another, and create positive momentum.

## How can we coach team members to help others?

### What good looks like

+ Encourage peer recognition (e.g., set a team norm to write a 2-minute thank you note every day).
+ Remind team members that it is everyone's role to enhance the experience of others on the team.

### What great looks like

+ Develop norms encouraging team members to give their views (e.g., everyone should withhold judgment during brainstorming and ideation).
+ Coach team members to support each other (e.g., ask them to encourage each other to speak up).
+ Steer team members away from behaviors that might limit psychological safety.
+ Provide feedback and coaching to individual team members on their contributions to psychological safety.
