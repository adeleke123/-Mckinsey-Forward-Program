## Try it: Reframing mistakes

Your team is reviewing the customer feedback from a recent project. The feedback is mixed, with most of the negative reviews coming in the part of the project that Olivia—one of the team members—had led. Olivia is visibly upset. When another team member, Ming, asks her to explain what happened, she begins to talk about everything that went wrong: how the team failed to meet certain deadlines, how team members had to work outside their areas of expertise, and how, ultimately, their great ideas did not seem to have an impact. Olivia takes responsibility for her team’s failure to meet their standards, and she apologizes.
